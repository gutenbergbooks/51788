<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<span class="small">A BABE IN THE HOUSE IS A WELL-SPRING OF
PLEASURE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">TRIXY was not a babe, for she had passed
her seventh birthday and was as wise
and irrepressible as the only child of a loving
father and mother usually becomes. Her
parents and relations continued to allude to her
as "the baby," and they might still be doing so
had not certain of her deeds checked them, and
compelled them to restrict themselves to her
rightful name, which was Beatrice, and to her
nickname, which was Trixy.</p>

<p>Trif was Trixy's mother, and did not entirely
approve of the name by which she was oftenest
addressed, for "Trif" seemed to imply something
trifling, while the real Trif was a young
matron as handsome and proud as Diana, and
as good and earnest as the saintly Roman woman
Tryphosa, for whom she was named. (All this
must be true, because Trif's husband, Phil
Highwood, said so and continues to say it.)</p>

<p>Whether she laughed or wept, dressed or
dusted, joked or prayed, Trif did it with all her
might; so it was not strange that her little
daughter was a very active and earnest creature
from the instant at which she first opened her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
baby lips to announce her appearance upon the
earthly stage.</p>

<p>Besides, Trixy's father was one of the conscientious
and nervous fellows who are always
wondering what to do next, always anxious to do
exactly what is right, always trying to do friendly
services to other people, and frequently blundering
horribly in the attempt; so there was double
reason for what Trif called "dear Trixy's peculiarities"
and other people alluded to as "that
child's awful doings."</p>

<p>Trif and Trixy lived far up town on the west
side of New York. The husband of the one and
the father of the other lived there too, although
he is of minor consequence in this veracious
narrative, for the neighbors and tradesmen knew
him best as "that little terror's father," or
"Mrs. Highwood's husband," and he was modest
enough and proud enough to be satisfied to be
known in this way.</p>

<p>With the family lived Trif's sister, Tryphena
Wardlow, known best to her friends as Fenie&mdash;a
charming and exuberant girl who thought her
sister Trif the most perfect woman alive, was
sure that Trixy was the embodiment of all the
baby angels in heaven, and declared that she
never, never, never would think of marrying until
some man as simply perfect as her brother-in-law,
Phil Highwood, should ask her, and as that
seemed impossible she had determined, at the
mature age of twenty years, to remain single forever,
yet never become that dreadful creature
called "an old maid."</p>

<p>Fenie had no lack of suitors, old and young,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
for all men like handsome girls who are also
good, merry and accomplished; besides common
report had it that Fenie and her sister drew
between them five thousand dollars a year from
the estate of their New England parents. Common
report had set the figure about ten times
too high, but never took the trouble to correct
the mistake, so Fenie was the most attractive
young woman of the vicinity, and many were
the times when a merry evening which had been
planned by Phil, Trif, Fenie, and Trixy, was
spoiled by the appearance of some male visitor
who had to be treated civilly, and who couldn't
tear himself away from the witchery of Fenie's
face and voice.</p>

<p>There was one young man, Harry Trewman,
whom Fenie seemed rather to like, and whom
Trif and Phil, with their larger knowledge of
human nature, wished their sister could like still
more, for he was intelligent, modest, and seemed
to have many virtues and no vices. They talked
much about him when they were alone&mdash;alone
except for Trixy, who was always so competent
to amuse herself and to be absorbed by her
books and dolls and her own thoughts that she
seemed deaf to anything that was being said,
for it generally took half a dozen separate and
distinct remarks to make her change her dress,
or wash her hands, or go to bed.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang one evening while the
family still lingered at the supper table, and the
servant brought a card to Fenie.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed the girl with a pout.
"Here comes Harry Trewman, just as we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
going to have a jolly game of parchesi with the
baby. I do think that callers might remain at
home on stormy nights, when a girl hasn't taken
the pains to dress for company. That young
man needs a lesson. He has sisters and they
ought to teach him that ladies don't expect calls
on stormy nights."</p>

<p>"It won't take you long to change your dress,
dear," suggested Trif.</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Be not unmindful to entertain strangers,
for thereby some have entertained angels unawares,'"
quoted Phil, as he quartered a second
orange for Trixy.</p>

<p>"Angels&mdash;umph!" exclaimed Fenie. "Harry
Trewman doesn't resemble any angel of whom
I ever saw a picture. He's no stranger either,
goodness knows; he's been here at least once a
week for a long time. You shouldn't ever quote
Scripture, Phil, unless the application is entirely
correct."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; 'Flee from the wrath to
come.' Nothing makes Trif so provoked as
delay in greeting a visitor."</p>

<p>"Poor little Trixy. Her game will have to be
put off," murmured Fenie as she rose from the
table and kissed her niece.</p>

<p>"Never mind me," said Trixy, from behind a
kiss and a mouthful of orange. "The game will
keep, but Mr. Trewman won't, if you don't be
more careful."</p>

<p>"Won't keep?" exclaimed Fenie, with a
frown at the child and a suspicious glance at the
remainder of the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trixy!" exclaimed Trif in her most severe
tone, while Phil put another section of orange
into the child's mouth and his hand over her lips,
while Trif continued:</p>

<p>"Go along, Fenie. Change your dress quickly;
I'll run up stairs and help you."</p>

<p>"And I," said Trixy, after a struggle with the
orange and her father's hand, "I'll entertain Mr.
Trewman till you come down."</p>

<p>Three adult smiles were slyly exchanged as
the child assumed an air of importance, tumbled
out of her high-chair and started toward the
parlor, while her mother and aunt slipped up the
back stairway and Phil buried his face in the
evening paper.</p>

<p>"Good evenin', Harry," said the little maid, as
she bounced into the parlor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trixy!" exclaimed the young man rising
in haste. "How do you do, little girl? I'm
very much obliged to you for calling me Harry.
It sounds as if you rather liked me."</p>

<p>"So I do," replied Trixy. "I s'pose I ought
to have said 'Mr. Trewman,' but papa and
mamma and Aunt Fee always calls you 'Harry'
when they talk about you, so I said it without
thinkin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, they do, eh?" Mr. Trewman's clear
complexion flushed pleasurably and his moustache
was twirled thoughtfully. If the family
talked of him familiarly, there seemed special
reason for him to hope.</p>

<p>"Yes, they do it lots. I get sick of it sometimes,
'cause I want to ask 'em somethin', and
mamma says I mustn't ever interrupt grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
people when they're talkin', so I can't ask it, and
afterward maybe I forget what I was going to
ask, and that bothers me like ev'rythin'."</p>

<p>"You poor little sufferer!" exclaimed the
young man. "I ought to do something very
nice for you, to make amends for causing you so
much trouble. What kind of candy do you most
like?&mdash;or mayn't I bring you a new doll?"</p>

<p>"Papa and mamma don't like me to eat candy,"
said Trixy with a sigh. "They say it's bad
for my 'gestion. Have you got a 'gestion?"</p>

<p>The young man admitted that he had, but he
hastily reverted to dolls as a more appropriate
topic of conversation. Trixy looked troubled
and finally said:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Something always goes wrong.
I need a new baby doll awfully, for the kitten
bit the head off of my littlest one, but, you see,
papa and mamma says it isn't proper for young
ladies to accept presents from gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see&mdash;I beg a thousand pardons,"
Trewman gravely replied. "But would you
object to my asking your parents' permission to
give you a new doll&mdash;the finest one that I can
find?"</p>

<p>"Do it&mdash;quick!" exclaimed Trixy, her eyes
dancing and her hands clapping gleefully. "I
don't think, though," she continued, after a
moment or two of thought, "that I ought to
take somethin' for nothin', for papa says that
folks who do that are real mean."</p>

<p>"Something for nothing? Why, you dear
little bundle of conscience, I'm to give you the
doll in part payment for the trouble I have given
you. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes! To&mdash;be&mdash;sure. Well, I forget my
troubles as soon as I tell 'm, so&mdash;so you don't
owe me anything."</p>

<p>Trixy looked sad as the promised doll began
to disappear from her mental vision, so the
young man said quickly:</p>

<p>"You must have the doll, now that we've
talked about it, and so that I mayn't lose the
pleasure of giving it to you. You can give me
something for it, if you like&mdash;for instance, give
me a penny, to wear on my watch-chain."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," exclaimed Trixy, her
face suddenly brightening. "I'll give you a
lesson for it. You like lessons, don't you&mdash;I like
'em&mdash;like all I can get, and I've got one for you
that Aunt Fee says you need, so I'm sure you'll
like it, 'cause ev'rybody likes what they need,
don't they?"</p>

<p>The young men admitted that they ought, if
they didn't, but his face quickly became grave,
and he looked furtively toward the door through
which Fenie would appear, as he whispered:</p>

<p>"Tell it to me&mdash;quickly."</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't a very big lesson, but you
needn't give me a very big doll. Let me see&mdash;what
was that lesson she said you needed? Oh,
I remember: she said that young men ought to
know better than to go calling on stormy nights,
when ladies don't dress up and be ready to see
company. She said you needed a lesson about
it, and you had sisters, and they ought to teach
it to you. Mebbe, though, your sisters don't
like to give lessons?"</p>

<p>"They're not as active at it as they might be,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
replied the man as he arose hastily and took
from his coat pocket a small package. "But&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps
I am not as much to blame as I seem.
I dropped in to leave a book which your Aunt
Fee wished to read but couldn't find, and I
promised to get it for her. I might have left it
at the door, but I was thinking very hard at the
time about&mdash;about a person in whom I am
greatly interested, so I managed to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you do that?" asked Trixy, following
the young man, who was moving rapidly
toward the front door.</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Why, think of one thing while you ought to
be doing some other thing? 'Cause if you do,
you're just like me."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my child," said Trewman, as he
opened the outer door, "I do it all the while.
Indeed, no matter what I am doing nowadays,
my mind is full of another subject."</p>

<p>"Dear me. What a nice subject it must be!"</p>

<p>"So it is;&mdash;the very nicest subject in the
world."</p>

<p>"Oh! What is it?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you now. Good-night!"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me some other time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;that is, I hope I may."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, when Miss Tryphena
Wardlow descended to the parlor she found only
Trixy, who was rocking ecstatically in her own
little chair and thinking of the doll to come.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Trewman?" asked the young
woman.</p>

<p>"He's gone. He left this book for you, but he
took his lesson with him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lesson? What lesson?"</p>

<p>"Why, the one you said he needed. I gave it
to him, and he's goin' to give me a doll for it."</p>

<p>Fenie looked puzzled for a moment; then her
face became very red and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You dreadful child! Do you really mean
that you have repeated to Harry Trewman
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fenie stopped abruptly, darted to the foot of
the stairs, shouted "Trif!" dashed through the
hall to the dining room, and exclaimed, "Phil,
come into the parlor&mdash;this instant." In a
moment a mystified couple was staring at a
young woman whose beauty was enhanced by a
great flush of indignation; they also saw a tearful
little girl who seemed to be trying to shrink
into nothingness.</p>

<p>It took an hour of scolding, and petting, and
warning, and kissing to prepare Trixy for bed,
but when the child was finally disposed of Phil
drawled:</p>

<p>"If you girls don't want things repeated by
that child you mustn't say them in her hearing."</p>

<p>"But she never seems to notice what is said,"
explained Fenie.</p>

<p>"Umph! Neither does a phonograph cylinder,
but it gets them all the same."</p>

<p>"All this talk about Trixy doesn't make our
position toward Harry Trewman any the less
awkward," said Trif gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother Harry Trewman," exclaimed
Fenie; but there was a look in her face which
compelled Phil to glance slyly at his wife, and
Trif to respond with a merry twinkle of her
eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<span class="small">A TRANSACTION IN COTTON.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE week that followed the Trixy-Trewman
incident was a trying one to Trif. Her
sister Fenie, although an intelligent and well-educated
young woman who could talk well on
many subjects, and whose interests were generally
as broad as those of a clever young woman should
be, would converse about nothing but the dreadful
position in which Trixy had placed her toward
a young man whom she cared no more for
than for old Father Adam&mdash;indeed, not as much,
for Adam was regarded by all good people of
New England extraction as a member of the
family, although somewhat remotely removed.</p>

<p>As for Trif, she had no patience with a girl
who did not know her own mind. When she
had first met Phil Highwood, nearly ten years
before, she knew at once what to think of him,
and she had never changed her mind. Neither
had she thought it necessary to talk of him to
the exclusion of everything and everybody
else&mdash;not at least until she had been married to
him and before Trixy made her appearance as
the eighth wonder of the world and the most
important creature ever born.</p>

<p>It would never do, she argued, to betray her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
feelings to and about her sister, for she had determined
to have Harry Trewman for a brother-in-law,
and her husband loyally supported her in
her decision. But what was to be done?</p>

<p>Upon one thing she and her sister were
resolved, and one morning after breakfast the
couple called upon Phil to witness their resolution,
which was that they would never again say
in Trixy's hearing anything which could make
mischief by being repeated. Phil listened with
a smile so provoking that Fenie called him perfectly
horrid, while Trif playfully but vigorously
boxed his ears.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll keep that resolution," Phil admitted.
"I've no doubt whatever that both of
you will live up to it&mdash;while the dear child is
asleep, but if either of you blessed women think
that you're going to leave anything unsaid that
you want to say while you're together you're
dangerously mistaken. You've been sisters and
chums too long to hold your tongues at home."</p>

<p>"I flatter myself," said Trif loftily, while
Fenie pouted exuberantly, "that we have sense
enough to make each other understand what we
have to say, and at the same time keep the child
from knowing what we are talking about."</p>

<p>"Women aren't like men," added Fenie. "It
isn't always necessary for them to talk to make
themselves understood. Trif has told me thousands
of things with her eyes, without saying a
word."</p>

<p>"She certainly has a remarkable faculty at
that sort of thing," said Phil, with a gentle pinch
at his wife's cheek. "She often conversed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
me across the entire width of a crowded room&mdash;just
as you'll probably do, Fenie dear, when the
proper man appears. At the present time, however,
there's no sign that either of you will let
your tongues suffer through lack of exercise."</p>

<p>"Trif," said Fenie, "isn't it about time for
your husband to be on his way to his office? I'm
sure his employers will complain of him for being
late."</p>

<p>When Phil had departed, the two women, to
make assurance doubly sure, called Trixy and
gave a full hour of cautions against repeating
anything whatever that she might chance to
overhear in the house. She was reminded that
she was mamma's and auntie's little lady, and
that ladies never repeat what is said in the home
circle, and that nobody liked tale-bearers, and
that, although Harry Trewman was not of the
slightest consequence&mdash;Fenie was elaborately
explicit on this point&mdash;some dear friend of the
family might be greatly offended by hearing
something which was said only in fun.</p>

<p>Trixy listened attentively and promised profusely;
then she retired to her doll's nursery to
have a long season of thought over all that had
been said. Fenie often worried about the habits
of the child, for dreaming was more to her own
taste, but Trif said that Trixy's way was entirely
natural and proper; she had exactly the same
manner when she was a little girl; besides, according
to Phil's parents, the child's father had
done much retiring for thought in his youthful
days.</p>

<p>But Trixy had much besides thinking to do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
She felt greatly mortified at having made any
trouble, and the less there seemed to be of the
trouble, according to her Aunt Fee, the more of
it there was&mdash;according to Trif. She reverted
to the subject, again and again, asking numberless
questions at unexpected times, generally
with the result of bringing a blush to Fenie's face.
When Trif asked her husband what it could be
that made the child so curious, despite all that
had been done to belittle Harry Trewman in
connection with the incident, Phil's only reply
was:</p>

<p>"There's an old saying to the point&mdash;'You
can't fool a child or a dog.'"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trixy went on thinking, and one
day she came to her mother with a confession.</p>

<p>"You see, mamma, I thought about it a lot,
and I thought the best way not to repeat things
was not to hear 'em, so I made up my mind that
I wouldn't listen any more to anything that
wasn't said right straight to me."</p>

<p>"Sensible little girl," exclaimed Trif, showing
her approval further by a shower of caresses and
kisses.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Trixy, trying to escape, "but you
don't know how bad I am. Since I made up
my mind to stop hearing things I've heard more
of them than ever."</p>

<p>"You poor little darling," exclaimed Trif,
snatching the child into her arms, "you must
stop tormenting yourself in that manner. Stop
thinking about it, dear. Listen when you like,
and when you don't. Perhaps that will cure
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I know a better way than that," said
Trixy, perching herself upon her mother's knee,
and looking up with the expression of a cherub.
"You remember that time when I had the earache
and you put cotton, with smelly stuff on it,
in my ears? Well, I couldn't hear a thing then.
Now, I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, dear," exclaimed Trif. "You talk
as if you were some dreadful creature from
somewhere, instead of mamma's darling, sweet,
good little daughter."</p>

<p>A morning call put an end to the interview,
but a few hours later, while Trif was sewing
busily and Fenie was talking volubly and aimlessly
about Harry Trewman, a light step was
heard in the room, and Fenie dropped her subject
for a moment, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Tryphosa Wardlow Highwood, will you look
at your daughter&mdash;this instant?"</p>

<p>Trixy was evidently expecting to be looked
at, and was pleased at the effect of her appearance.
Over each ear was a great dark ball or
wad of something, her mother could not imagine
what, until examination showed that the outside
of each was a rubber tobacco pouch, two or three
of which Phil had discarded when he gave up
smoking pipes. Inside of each was a mass of
raw cotton, and the mouth of each bag was tied
tightly around a juvenile ear.</p>

<p>"I can't hear hardly a thing," shouted Trixy.
"A little bit of cotton in each ear didn't make
much difference, but a whole lot on the outside
made lots, and the bags made more, beside keeping
the cotton on. Now go on talkin' all you
like; I'm goin' to read."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"She shan't wear those dreadful things," exclaimed
Fenie, untying the bags, despite Trixy's
remonstrances. "She shan't keep cotton in her
ears, either. The idea of the darling little thing
being&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let her have her way a little while," said
Trif. "It will amuse her, without harming any
one else. Besides, you may accidentally mention
Harry Trewman in the course of the afternoon,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There must have been a note of sarcasm in
Trif's voice, for Fenie retorted sharply:</p>

<p>"Tryphosa, this is your house, and if you dislike
that young man so much that you object to
the child hearing the sound of his name, why
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fenie! Fenie, dear!" interrupted Trif,
scarcely able to control her voice and not daring
to lift her eyes from the work which she had
resumed. "Whatever you like to talk about,
you know I like to hear about. Aren't you my
only sister, and my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose that I talked much about
Harry Trewman," said Fenie, making a pretense
of sewing industriously.</p>

<p>"You mean nothing but what is entirely right,
dear girl."</p>

<p>"Then why do you object to that innocent child
hearing what I say? I'm sure that I say nothing
which any one might not listen to&mdash;do I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; still, don't you remember
what happened a night or two ago, dear, through
a certain child hearing something and repeating
it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;" here Fenie looked cautiously
toward Trixy, who was reading, with an air of
utter absorption&mdash;"but I'm not likely to speak so
foolishly again. Trif, do let me take the cotton
from that child's ears. It is making her uncomfortable.
See. She is rubbing one of her ears
now."</p>

<p>"She is sensible enough to complain when it
really hurts. You don't imagine that her mother
will let her suffer, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;well as I was saying, I don't really
talk much about Harry Trewman, do I?"</p>

<p>Trif looked up so intently and roguishly that
Fenie blushed deeply, and the blush remained
while Trif said softly:</p>

<p>"Really, dear, you don't talk much about anything
else."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can say that," replied
Fenie with uncertain voice, "when you know
that I don't care anything&mdash;or not much, for
him or about him. I don't suppose I would
have spoken his name a single time this week
if he hadn't come here last week, and if Trixy
hadn't made that dreadful blunder. You certainly
don't think me in love with him, I hope?"</p>

<p>"I hope not, dear. There are many gradations
of feeling that a true woman must go
through before she can say honestly that she
is in love. But you&mdash;well, you like him a little
better than you like any other of your admirers,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es, I suppose I do," replied Fenie, her
voice not entirely under control. "He is gentlemanly,
and honest-looking, and never brings the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
odor of liquor or tobacco with him. He doesn't
make silly attempts at flattery, and he talks a
great deal about his sisters, who are very nice
girls, and he knows when to go home, instead of
dawdling here until midnight, and we like the
same books and pictures, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And so he is a pleasant acquaintance to
have&mdash;too pleasant to lose entirely?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and if it hadn't been for that
dreadful child&mdash;there, Trif, she's rubbing that
ear again. I'm sure she's in pain. Do let me
remove that ridiculous cotton."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut. Go on. You were saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, what was I saying? What were we
talking about?" asked Fenie, with charming but
entirely transparent hypocrisy. "Oh, I was
merely going to say that if Trixy hadn't made
that dreadful speech to him the other night, I
wouldn't have missed one delightful party&mdash;perhaps
two, to which he and his oldest sister
would have taken me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. 'Tis only the parties that trouble
you."</p>

<p>"Tryphosa," exclaimed Fenie indignantly, as
she arose from her chair, "I think you're real
unkind&mdash;real tormenting. First you make fun of
me for talking a lot about him, and then you
make me talk about him a great deal more. I
wasn't going to say a word about him this
afternoon, but you've kept me at it in spite of
myself. Perhaps you don't want me to like him.
Well, I shan't oblige you. I do like him. I'm
not a bit in love with him, but I do like him
ever so much, and I'm not a bit ashamed to say
so. There!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Trif, springing from her
chair and throwing her arms about her sister.
"I'm glad that at last you know your own mind.
Now stop acting like a child, and be the woman
you have the right to be. I'm proud of you, my
darling sister&mdash;proud of your honesty and spirit.
But&mdash;why, my dear girl, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Harry's been driven away from here," sobbed
Fenie, "and I'm dreadful unhappy about it, and
I want him to come back."</p>

<p>"Hurrah," sounded a high childish treble.
The sisters looked in the direction of the sound,
and there stood Trixy, with glowing cheeks and
dancing eyes as she continued:</p>

<p>"I want him to come back, too, for he promised
to bring me a doll."</p>

<p>"Trixy," exclaimed Fenie severely. Trixy
understood at once and looked guilty, but she
explained:</p>

<p>"One of the cottons dropped out, and I didn't
know a thing about it till you boo-hoo'd."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"PHIL," said Trif from her pillow one
morning very early, "are you awake?"</p>

<p>Phil half wished he wasn't, for he was just
sinking into the morning's final doze, but loyalty
compelled him to admit that he was not asleep.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," responded Trif, "for I've
thought out a plan for making matters right
once more between Fenie and Harry."</p>

<p>"So have I, my dear, so between us we'll be
sure to succeed. Now let's drop asleep again;
if we talk much we'll get Trixy awake far too
long before breakfast, which won't be good for
her."</p>

<p>"There's no danger. The dear little thing
sleeps soundly nowadays. What is your plan?"</p>

<p>"'Tis simply to invite him and his sister
Kate to dinner."</p>

<p>"How stupid! You don't suppose he'll come
after what he heard the last time he was here?"</p>

<p>"Won't come? Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because he was rudely driven away."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Did you ever drive flies from
sugar or sweetmeats? Didn't they return as
soon as they saw a ghost of a chance?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think the comparison is complimentary,
either to my sister or to Harry."</p>

<p>"Why not? Fenie is the sweetest creature
that I know of, except you, and if Harry can or
will keep away from her he's not half the man I
take him to be."</p>

<p>"But he certainly has some self-respect?"</p>

<p>"Yes, far too much to be discouraged by a
single rebuff. Do you suppose I'd have lost you
through any such reason as you think is keeping
him away at present? I suppose he may be
feeling dismal, poor fellow, but at the same time
he's learning how much he cares for Fenie,
which isn't a bad sort of knowledge for a young
man to have. As to Fenie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h&mdash;! I didn't mean to tell you about
her, for the secret is hers, not mine, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you couldn't keep anything from your
husband, oh? Well, this heart is a safe place
to come to with confidences."</p>

<p>"Phil, dear. Do be serious a moment!"</p>

<p>"I never was more serious in my life, my
dear. Haven't I just ruined the last nap to
which I was entitled? As to the young people,
we'll have Harry and his sister to dinner as soon
as you like. The sister will come, because she
likes your dinners, your sister and you; Harry
will come rather than explain to his sister. He
and Fenie will feel so uncomfortable at first that
they will be unusually affable to each other, and
within half an hour they will be far better friends
than ever before. Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," exclaimed Trif, with an
impulsive kiss, "you're a born match-maker."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pshaw," exclaimed Phil, pretending not to
be delighted with the compliment, "I'm merely
a common-sense judge of human nature. If
you'll only keep your irrepressible baby from
hearing things in the meantime, and saying
them to the wrong people, everything will go
well."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't imagine how she can make
any trouble. I'm sure that Fenie has given her
cautions enough during the last week, to make
the child afraid to say a word about anything to
anyone who shouldn't hear it. At least once an
hour, all day long, it has been 'Trixy, don't'&mdash;and
'Trixy, don't'&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't what, mamma?" drawled a gentle
voice from a crib near the bed.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear. Go to sleep again." The
remaining conversation between husband and
wife was conducted in soft whispers.</p>

<p>Several hours later Harry Trewman's sister
Kate dropped in, "just for a moment." Kate
was a wide-awake young woman, several years
Fenie's senior. She had seen that something
was troubling her brother, and it took very little
time for her to determine that Fenie was the
something. In Kate's opinion Harry, although
little more than a year younger than she, was a
mere boy who needed sisterly management, and
Kate was not the woman to shirk any family
duty.</p>

<p>Trif and Fenie chanced to be out shopping,
and Kate was departing when Trixy came
through the hall with some doll's garments
which had just been laundered. Each looked
at the other inquiringly, and Trixy said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you bring it?"</p>

<p>"Bring what, Trixy?"</p>

<p>"Why, the doll your brother Harry promised
me. I thought maybe he sent it by you, seeing
he doesn't come here any more."</p>

<p>"Doesn't come here any more?"</p>

<p>"No. Didn't he tell you?"</p>

<p>Kate hesitated a moment before answering.
To extract information from a child or a servant
seemed to her a very mean act&mdash;when other
women did it. On the other hand, she owed
loyal service to her brother, who was utterly incapable
of managing his own affairs, so far as
young women were concerned. Besides, Kate
was sure that she was simply dying of curiosity,
so she choked her sense of propriety and replied:</p>

<p>"I don't know until you make me fully understand
what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"Why," said Trixy, opening her eyes very
wide, "he learned a lesson here, and I taught it
to him, though Aunt Fee said his sisters ought
to have done it. 'Twas that young men oughtn't
to go calling stormy evenings when young ladies
don't expect company and put on their nicest
dresses. He was going to give me a doll for
teachin' him the lesson, but he hasn't sent it yet,
and I've been hopin' for it ev'ry day, and
thinkin' he'd bring it, but Aunt Fee says he
won't come here any more, and she cried a whole
lot about it the other day, and&mdash;&mdash;. Why, don't
you know it ain't polite to go away while somebody's
talking to you? I'm 'stonished."</p>

<p>Kate had moved abruptly toward the door;
she had learned all she wanted to know, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
was feeling very uncomfortable with the information
which followed, so she said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Trixy, but I'm afraid you're telling
me more than you should. Little girls
shouldn't repeat all they hear; haven't your
parents ever told you so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," assented Trixy cheerfully; "they
was dreadfully worried for fear I'd say something
to the wrong people. The idea of it!"
Trixy found the idea so funny that she laughed
heartily; Kate at the same time wished she had
not entered the house. She thought rapidly and
said:</p>

<p>"Trixy dear, let's have a nice little secret between
you and me. Don't say anything to anyone
about our chat this morning, or that I've
been here, until I say you may, and I will give
you two dolls&mdash;half a dozen dolls, if you like,
and then we'll both together tell the whole story
to your mama and your Aunt Fenie, and have a
great joke about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, good, good, good!" exclaimed Trixy,
trying to climb up to Kate's face to kiss it, for
Trixy was a grateful little thing, and dearly
loved a joke and a secret, probably because she
couldn't possibly keep either of them. She bestowed
her kiss, with several others to keep it
company, and Miss Trewman left the house just
in time to meet Trif and Fenie about a hundred
steps away. She passed them briskly, although
with a cheery "Good morning," but in a moment
she asked herself:</p>

<p>"I wonder if they'll suspect? Thank goodness,
I didn't leave my card."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Trif!" said Fenie. "She looked as if
she had been at our house. I do hope she didn't
meet Trixy."</p>

<p>"Fenie!" exclaimed Trif indignantly, although
she had been impressed by the same hope, or
fear, "don't act like an insane person. The
entire world doesn't revolve about you and
Harry Trewman."</p>

<p>Fenie was suppressed for the moment, but
when she entered the house and saw Trixy
capering ecstatically through the parlor, and
singing shrilly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Half a dozen dolls;</span>
<span class="i2">Half a dozen dolls;</span>
<span class="i4">Half a dozen,</span>
<span class="i4">Half a dozen,</span>
<span class="i2">Half a dozen dolls.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Trixy, has any one been here?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, 'cause it's a secret. Say,
Aunt Fee, ain't the Trewmans awful rich? I
should think they must be, if one of them can
give away six dolls at a time."</p>

<p>"Oh, Trif!" exclaimed Fenie, posing like a
tragedy queen, "'twas just as I feared."</p>

<p>"Trixy," said Trif gently as she seated herself
and drew the child to her side, "when Miss
Trewman was here, did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, has she let out the secret already?
Dear me! Some grown folks are leaky, as well
as little girls, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"She told me nothing," replied Trif, "so I
want you to tell me what you said to her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, mamma dear, I can't, 'cause it's a secret
and both of us are to tell it to you together."</p>

<p>"When?" asked Fenie in a tone that made
the child tremble as she replied:</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I hope awful soon, 'cause
then she's goin' to give me&mdash;oh, I almost told."</p>

<p>"Almost told what?" Fenie demanded.
"Don't you know that little girls have no right
to keep things secret from their mothers?"</p>

<p>Trixy looked up pitifully. Fenie's face, which
as long as Trixy could remember, had been full
of smiles and dimples, was now stern and commanding.
Trixy's eyes filled with tears, but
Fenie's face remained stern and unrelenting.</p>

<p>"You don't want me to tell lies, I hope, and
be burned a whole lot after I die?" sobbed the
child.</p>

<p>"I'd almost rather you'd tell lies than repeat
some things which you think are true."</p>

<p>"Fenie!" exclaimed Trif. Then it was Fenie's
turn to cry. Trif banished her with a look, and
then began to question the child; but just outside
the door stood a young woman with the air of a
person determined to hear whatever was said,
no matter how true might be the old saying that
listeners never hear any good of themselves.</p>

<p>"You may keep your secret, dear, or what is
left of it," said Trif, taking Trixy upon her knee.
"Mamma knows that Miss Trewman was here,
but you did not tell her, so don't feel bad about
it. I hope, though, that you didn't forget all
that's been said to you about talking about
family affairs to persons whom they don't
concern."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, mamma dear, I wouldn't do such a
dreadful thing. But Miss Trewman's brother
wasn't a thing that didn't concern her, was he?"</p>

<p>Fenie, outside the door, wiped her eyes and
wrung her hands as Trif replied:</p>

<p>"That depends upon what you said about
him."</p>

<p>"Why, I only said he didn't come here no
more, and I was awful sorry, 'cause he promised
me a doll, and I've been waitin' for it awful
hard. And it wasn't wrong, was it, to say that
Aunt Fee was awful sorry too, and cried a whole
lot about it? You know the Trewman girls like
Aunt Fee, ever so much."</p>

<p>There was a pronounced rustle in the hall,
and Trif and Trixy hurried out just in time to
see a sobbing girl hurrying up the stair. They
followed her, but Fenie dashed into her own
room, slammed the door, and shot the bolt with
much unnecessary noise. She paid no attention
to many knocks and gentle calls by her sister,
so finally Trif sat down upon the top stair,
placed her elbows on her knees and her face in
her hands, and looked so unhappy that Trixy
cuddled to her side and kissed and caressed her.
The child got no response, but a sad look which
was so reproachful and prolonged that Trixy
herself burst into tears and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wish I hadn't ever come down
from heaven, or done anythin', or anythin', or
anythin'."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<span class="small">IN CHARGE OF EACH OTHER.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">HARRY TREWMAN and his sister were invited
to dine with the Highwoods, although
Fenie declared that after what had been said to
them, neither of them would think for an instant
of coming. For herself, she was sure that she
couldn't and wouldn't face them for all the
world, and that she never wanted to see either
of them again. Should they accept the invitation,
Fenie declared that she would excuse
herself with the sick headache, which she certainly
would have on the occasion.</p>

<p>When, however, the Trewmans did decline,
on the plea of a previous engagement, Fenie
was so inconsistent as to declare that she was
the most miserable person alive, and that she
wished she was dead.</p>

<p>Then every one in the house, from the master
down to the single servant, became wretched,
for Fenie had always been a cheerful creature,
romping with Trixy as if she herself was not
more than seven years old, singing merrily
throughout the day, and working harder than
any hireling when there was work to be done.</p>

<p>Trif talked sensibly to the girl; Phil joked
with her, but Trixy remained almost as silent as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
a mute, and looked as if she were laboring under
a heavy load of remorse and contrition. Even
her father's boisterous play, of which she was as
fond as if she were a boy, was treated as if it
was far too good for her, and as if she had no
right to enjoy it. Then Phil began to worry.</p>

<p>"Trif," said he, "you must reason that child
out of her remorse, or you'll have an invalid on
your hands."</p>

<p>"I hope and pray that I may not, for I already
have one invalid. I'm seriously frightened about
Fenie. The only fault I've ever had to find with
her was that she never would take things seriously,
no matter how important they were, but
now&mdash;oh, it seems as if all the seriousness of
the Wardlow blood was concentrated in her, and
all on account of the innocent blundering of that
darling child. I know the affair is shattering
her health, and sometimes I fear it is injuring
her reason."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Give her a change of some
kind, and she'll recover quickly. At present she
doesn't love that fellow, although I suppose she
thinks she does&mdash;girls as young as she are very
likely to mistake mere interest in a man for something
more serious. Take her, and Trixy, on a
little trip somewhere&mdash;run down to Florida and
back. This is just the season for such a trip."</p>

<p>"Philip Highwood! You talk as if we were
made of money. We haven't a fortune."</p>

<p>"But we have, my dear; we have two fortunes.
Fenie is one and Trixy is the other, and
I don't intend to lose either, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"A trip to Florida may cost all we've saved."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does that matter, if it saves Fenie
and Trixy for us? "</p>

<p>Phil had his way in the end, for the good and
sufficient reason that he and Trif loved each
other so well that it took but a few moments'
talk to make the way of one the way of both, no
matter who devised it. The Florida trip cost
Phil some pangs, for he had intended to start a
country home in the spring&mdash;a modest one, but
everything costs money in this practical world
of ours. He did not look forward with pleasure,
either, to being separated from his wife and
child for a fortnight or more, for they had
seldom been apart more than a single day;
nevertheless, he kept all these things to himself,
although he did much thinking about them.</p>

<p>As to the travelers, Trif assured Fenie, in
entire honesty, that Phil was dreadfully troubled
about Trixy's health, upon which Fenie made
haste to show that she really could think of more
than one thing at a time.</p>

<p>Trixy was informed, with equal care, but far
more detail, that her Aunt Fee was quite ill,
but that not a word was to be said about it in
any circumstances, even to Aunt Fee herself.</p>

<p>"I know all about it," said the child, her eyes
filling with tears, "and I was the dreadful little
girl that made her sick. I thought lots about
it, and prayed lots about it, and cried whole
pillows-ful about it, but it hasn't done any
good."</p>

<p>"Now is the time to do a lot of good, dear;
you can mend your ways by trying to help mend
Aunt Fee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was arranged that Trixy should regard
herself as her Aunt Fee's one special nurse during
the Southern trip, and that Trif should be physician,
to be consulted whenever necessary, although
the best medicine, for the invalid, Trif
declared, would be some of Trixy's chat and
play.</p>

<p>"The best medicine she could have would be
a long look at Harry Trewman's face," added
Phil, as the child left the room. "If she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I just came back, mamma," said Trixy, returning
suddenly, "to tell papa that if Miss
Trewman brings around them&mdash;I mean those&mdash;half
a dozen dolls, that he'll express 'em to me,
won't he? 'Cause I've told all my other dolls
about it, and they look disappointeder and disappointeder
every mornin' when they wake up.
And papa'll send me any letters that come for
me, won't he?" Then Trixy danced away again,
while her father remarked:</p>

<p>"If that child's imagination keeps in growth
with her body, there'll be a woman novelist in
the family in the course of time."</p>

<p>Trif and Trixy and Fenie started for Florida
by easy stages, Phil having told his wife that
two or three stops could be made at places
where a sorrowful girl of temperament naturally
lively might have her thoughts diverted in spite
of any determination to the contrary.</p>

<p>The first stop was at Old Point Comfort,
which most young women who have been there
prefer to call Fortress Monroe, for the largest fort
in the United States is there, and within it are
always thirty or forty officers, who, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
young or old, make delightful company of themselves,
during their brief moments off duty, for
all charming women at the enormous hotel
which, with the fort, contains almost the entire
population of Old Point Comfort. For the rest,
there is little there but water and air&mdash;but such
water and air! At one side of the fort is the
James River, several miles wide, at the other
side is Chesapeake Bay, so wide that one cannot
see the other shore, while in front Hampton
Roads extends ten miles away, to the outskirts
of the ancient and picturesque city of Norfolk.</p>

<p>Fenie conscientiously intended to be unhappy,
no matter where she might be, no matter how
much attention she might give to Trixy. Besides,
the party arrived at the Point about sunrise
in early April, when scarcely any one was
stirring, and the outside of a great hotel is not
an inspiriting object to contemplate when there
is no human being visible to relieve it.</p>

<p>Trixy, however, had not determined to be anything
dreadful, so she was no sooner ashore and
feeling the gentle sea breeze upon her cheeks
and in her lungs, than she began running to
and fro on the beach in front of the hotel, and
tossing pebbles at Fenie, and even dropping a
small pebble between Fenie's collar and neck,
and Fenie called her a dreadful little wretch
and began to chase her, for there was no one by
to see, except Trif, who made no objection. The
sea air had been stimulating Fenie, too, and
before she had thought it possible to do anything
inconsistent with sentimental dismalness
she had acquired rosy cheeks, bright eyes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
an earnest longing for breakfast. As for Trif,
she sought the telegraph office to wire her
husband:</p>

<p>"Both invalids already much better."</p>

<p>After breakfast Trif chanced to meet an old
acquaintance on the piazza. Fenie, by a violent
effort, regained her sadness and declined to meet
any one. As Phil had said that ladies and children
could safely go about unattended at Old
Point, Trif begged Trixy to take her Aunt Fee
a long walk on the beach, and to play as freely
as she liked. Then Trif begged Fenie to keep
dear Trixy out of doors, under the mild sun and
in the invigorating air, and Fenie was glad of
an excuse to get away from other people, so
the couple strolled along the beach, in the
direction of the lighthouse and the water battery,
enjoying the strangeness of everything
they saw.</p>

<p>"What's that bird-cage on top of that funny
little straight up-and-down house for?" asked
Trixy, pointing to the lighthouse.</p>

<p>"That's not a bird-cage, dear. That is the
light that the Government puts in its window
here, to show the sailors the way home. It
burns very brightly, and all night long."</p>

<p>"Dear me! What a big gas bill the Government
must have to pay! Say, Aunt Fee, what's
that big black thing on the grass, on the top of
the wall of the fort?"</p>

<p>"That's a cannon."</p>

<p>"What is it for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to kill bad people with."</p>

<p>"Gracious! Is there such lots of bad people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
down here as that? Papa said the place was so
nice and safe."</p>

<p>"It is safe enough, dear, for us. The bad
people that are shot with cannons come here
from other countries."</p>

<p>"When do they come?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask me," said Fenie, who was
trying to keep from not keeping miserable, but
was not succeeding very well.</p>

<p>"Who shall I ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, one of the soldiers, I suppose."</p>

<p>Fenie sat upon a rock which formed part of a
little breakwater, looked out to sea, and took a
pensive attitude, while Trixy stood and stared at
the cannon, and wondered, and wished she knew
more about the killing of bad people by artillery.</p>

<p>Just then Lieutenant Bruce Jermyn, of the
artillery service, came from the flank of the
water battery and walked toward the hotel. He
was no pink-faced, slender youth, like lieutenants
in most military novels, but a handsome, stout,
manly-looking fellow of about thirty-five years,
like hundreds of other lieutenants of our army
in time of peace. Trixy saw him, hurried to
him, and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Soldier, will you please tell me when
you're going to kill some bad people with the
cannon?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Jermyn, taking his cigar from his
lips and raising his cap. "Oh, not until they
come here and insist upon being killed, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Why? Do they insist upon bein' killed, and
come here to have you do it for them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Um&mdash;er&mdash;well, we like to be ready, in case
they should come, although we hope they'll
stay away. I beg your pardon, but will you
tell me your name? You look very like some
one whom I used to know."</p>

<p>"My name's Trixy Highwood, and that's
Aunt Fee, sittin' on the rocks there, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And her last name is?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wardlow."</p>

<p>"Well, well." The officer did not sigh, but
he looked reminiscent; then he took both of
Trixy's hands, looked intently into the child's
face, and said:</p>

<p>"I knew your mother about ten years ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Fee." shouted Trixy. "Come
here&mdash;quick! Here's one of mamma's friends."</p>

<p>The awakening was somewhat rude, but when
Fenie turned her head and saw an officer approaching,
with Trixy, she at once became a
curious yet dignified young woman. She arose
and met the couple, as Jermyn saluted and said:</p>

<p>"The child is to blame for this interruption,
Miss Wardlow. I recognized her by her resemblance
to her mother, whom I hope you
may have heard speak of me. My name is
Jermyn. My battery was stationed in New York
Harbor a few years ago."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Fenie, in pleased surprise.
She had heard frequently of the young
officer whom Trif had admired greatly, before
Phil Highwood had laid siege to her heart.
Phil, too, had heard much about him, and feared
him, as any civilian suitor fears a rival who
wears a military uniform. Fenie had often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
wished she might one day meet the man of
whom she had heard so much, and now she was
face to face with him, and&mdash;really, what a fine-looking
fellow he was!</p>

<p>"What's inside of them&mdash;the cannons?" asked
Trixy.</p>

<p>"Nothing more dangerous than air," the officer
replied.</p>

<p>"Children are so idiotically curious," said
Fenie.</p>

<p>"Oh, merely naturally so. Mayn't I show your
niece one of the guns?&mdash;and won't you accompany
us? 'Tis but a step or two to the water
battery. By the way, I hope that Mr. and Mrs.
Highwood are here?"</p>

<p>"My sister is," Fenie replied. "We came
down here hastily&mdash;indeed, we are on our way to
Florida, for their dear child's health."</p>

<p>"I must do myself the honor of calling at
once."</p>

<p>"Won't you wait," said Trixy appealingly,
"until you show me the bad-people-killers?"</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Jermyn, "if afterward you
will guide me to your mother."</p>

<p>The visit to the guns was prolonged to include
a tour of the fort, about which Fenie was wildly
curious, for she had never been inside of a fort, as
her sister had in the days to which Jermyn had
alluded, and she and Trif were such inseparable
companions that she wished to know of everything
that Trif knew. Jermyn proved to be
capital company; besides, was he not a one-time
admirer of Fenie's sister? Fenie felt entirely at
ease with him, and she was delighted with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
strangeness of everything she saw, so soon she
was chatting as freely and cheerily as if she had
never known a trouble.</p>

<p>Later in the morning Trif, seated on the piazza
near the beach, was astonished to see her sister
approaching with an army officer, with whom
she seemed to be well acquainted. Soldiers
looked very much alike to Trif; besides, she was
so delighted at the sudden improvement in
Fenie's appearance that she did not recognize
Jermyn until her sister, with a roguish look, said:</p>

<p>"Trif, I'm astonished! Should auld acquaintance
be forgot?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Highwood!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Jermyn!"</p>

<p>Neither blushed, although Fenie had hoped
they would. As for Trixy, who had not had much
opportunity to talk during the walk through the
fort, she looked intently at her invalid charge,
her dear Aunt Fee. The instant there was a lull
in the conversation, Trixy could not help saying:</p>

<p>"Mamma, seems to me that somethin's made
Aunt Fee look awful weller all at once; don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>Then the blushes, for which Fenie had looked
in her sister's cheeks, hurried into her own, and
refused to depart.</p>

<span class="small">A SURPRISE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">"HERE'S a letter for you, Harry," said Kate
Trewman one morning as her brother
came to the breakfast table, "and from the penmanship
of the address I should imagine it to be
from a washerwoman or a newsboy."</p>

<p>Harry looked solemnly at the address&mdash;he had
looked solemnly at everything for several days,
but when he saw the signature he started, a motion
which did not escape the observant eye of
his sister, who exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Do tell me what has happened! You look
like an actor in a play with a great letter-scene
in it."</p>

<p>Harry did not reply, for he was trying to read
the letter, the writer of which could read, he
knew, but seemed not to have learned to write,
or even to spell, for the letter ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dere Mister Trumen: I wunt to git yure pikcher an if yu giv it tu me
yu needunt giv me that dolle tho I want the dolle lots an them yure
sistur wus goin to gimme. Plese send me the pikcher rite away cause
I'm goin a travelen. Youres trule</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Trixy Highwood</span>."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Do tell me what it is!" exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p>"'Tis a dead secret&mdash;or a mystery," Harry

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>

replied, with an absent-minded manner and a
far-away look. Then he re-read the letter and
laughed, at which Kate said:</p>

<p>"Thank goodness! Evidently it isn't a tragedy!"</p>

<p>"No, although there may be some elements of
a drama in it."</p>

<p>"Do let me see the letter."</p>

<p>"Not now, dear girl. It is on a matter which
I think should be regarded as strictly confidential."</p>

<p>Nevertheless Kate saw the letter before the
day was done, and she did a lot of thinking
about it. Then she drew her brother into the
parlor and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I've thought it all out. Fenie Wardlow
hasn't a picture of you, has she?"</p>

<p>"Kate!" exclaimed Harry severely. "Do
you imagine me to be conceited enough to present
my portrait to young women in general?"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! You know very well that Fenie
Wardlow isn't classed in your mind among young
women in general. She's the one and particular
woman of all the world, to you. Answer my
question; has she your picture?"</p>

<p>"No. Now are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely. Still, I'm sure she wants it.
That child never wrote you of her own accord,
to ask for your picture."</p>

<p>"Kate! Will you kindly remember that Miss
Wardlow is a lady? I'm surprised that you
should make such an insinuation."</p>

<p>"I've insinuated nothing, but there is something
behind Trixy's letter. She's a very longheaded

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>

child, and the family adores her, and she
is always with Trif and Fenie, and hears everything
they say, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you really think that Miss Wardlow herself
wanted a picture of me?" interrupted Harry.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I do think. Oh,
Harry! I didn't suppose a man could blush so
splendidly! There, there&mdash;don't be ashamed of
it; 'tis wonderfully becoming, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kate was an affectionate sister, so she stopped
long enough to throw her arms about her brother
and kiss him soundly. Then she continued:</p>

<p>"Send a picture to the child at once&mdash;and do
send that doll also. I'd send with it the lot that
I promised, if I wasn't afraid that the family
would ask questions, and I would be dreadfully
mortified if they were to learn that I questioned
Trixy closely on a certain subject several days
ago. I wish I knew what the child means by saying
that she's going travelling. I wonder if&mdash;oh,
well, I'll make some calls elsewhere, and find
out all about it."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trif, Trixy and Fenie were postponing
their further journeying southward. Old
Point Comfort is a hard place to leave; one
finds old friends, learns that new ones are coming;
so the days slip by delightfully. The air
seemed to be doing wonders for both Fenie and
Trixy, and Trif was enjoying herself as a clever
young woman always can where good company
abounds, and she can give her entire time to it.
Besides, Lieutenant Jermyn assured her that the
season was so far advanced that she would find
Florida uncomfortably hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Jermyn had also put Trif entirely at ease by
not showing a bit of sentimentality over the
woman he had loved and lost. He was so entirely
himself in her presence that she imagined
him happily married, although she did not like
to question him on the subject. He was quite
attentive to Fenie, too, and made haste to introduce
several brother officers, who made themselves
interesting, so Fenie seldom was without
the attendance of some man in uniform. Her
admirers were not all young, either, for admiration
of womanhood appears to be one of the
original elements of the military nature, so several
elderly officers frequently sought the society
of Fenie and her sister, and as Fenie was the
younger, and unmarried, she innocently took all
the admiration to herself. Finally, when a retired
admiral, himself as young at heart and
engaging in conversation as any of his juniors,
paid special attention to Fenie, that young woman
became so exuberant of cheerfulness that she
read herself a severe lecture, almost at midnight,
when there was no one else for her to talk to.</p>

<p>How dreadfully she was neglecting Trixy, too!
She had promised to watch the child carefully,
yet Trixy ran at will upon the beach, and buried
herself in sand, and several times a day she ventured
close enough to the water to wet her feet,
and Fenie was always going to keep her from
doing so again, but Trif was the only one who
did it. Fenie told herself that she was becoming
a dreadfully selfish girl, but really she never
seemed to find time to do anything that ought to
be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Trixy did such dreadful things, too. She
had learned the names of all the colored
men who brought sail-boats to the hotel pier
when the water was smooth and the breeze
gentle. She seemed fascinated by the picturesque
raggedness of the few colored people who
lounged in the single street of the little village.
She had no hesitation about introducing herself
to any one who spoke to Trif or Fenie, she
talked almost as much as if she were at home;
and what mightn't she say if the impulse came
to her? Trif was begged to caution the child,
that there was nothing to tell; then to make
assurance doubly sure, Fenie herself cautioned
her.</p>

<p>"I don't tell nobody nothin', Aunt Fee," protested
Trixy. "Really and truly, I don't. I
only told Lieutenant Jermyn and a lot of them
that you was awful sick, and that was why we
came down here."</p>

<p>"I sick? You dreadful child! Don't you
know that it was on account of your own bad
health that we came?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Fee! You're awful mistaken&mdash;indeed
you are. You must have got us mixed
up some way, 'cause papa and mamma said 'twas
you that was sick. I just came along to take
care of you, and I've been doin' it with all my
might."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And what was the matter with
me, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;y&mdash;y!" exclaimed the child, opening
her eyes very wide. "Do you forget things as
easy as that? Mamma said you'd go crazy if

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>

you didn't stop thinkin' about Harry Trewman,
and papa said the best medicine for you would
be a trip off to somewhere&mdash;the best, except
one thing."</p>

<p>"Except what thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'."</p>

<p>"Don't say that. Tell me the truth at once."</p>

<p>"I can't, else I'll spoil a s'prise."</p>

<p>"What surprise?"</p>

<p>"I mustn't tell, else there won't be no s'prise."</p>

<p>"Oh, Trixy! Surprises are such stupid
things! People usually find out all about them
before they occur."</p>

<p>"Nobody'll find out this one, I guess, unless
Harry&mdash;say, Aunt Fee, whereabouts is the post-office
here?"</p>

<p>"All letters come to the hotel. What were
you going to say about Harry? Harry who?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? Then I can't tell,
'cause that's part of the s'prise."</p>

<p>"Trixy, tell me this instant!"</p>

<p>Trixy looked troubled for a moment; then
she dashed out of the room, and Fenie, who had
been dressing while she talked, could not follow.
Trixy found her mother, who handed
her a letter of such size that the retired Admiral,
who was chatting with Trif, remarked:</p>

<p>"How large a letter for so small a lady to receive.
I hope, Miss Trixy, that you haven't a
love affair on your mind?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, sir. Other folk's love affairs are
enough for me to attend to." Then the child
slipped away, while Trif continued to wonder
from whom had come the letter which Phil had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>

forwarded, and which appeared to contain a
large photograph.</p>

<p>Trixy retired to the hotel, opened her letter,
and found, as she had expected, a picture of
Harry Trewman. There was some writing on
the back of the card, and Trixy wished she
knew what it was, but all chirography was as
undecipherable to her as Hebrew; her own letters
were written in imitation of print. She
roamed about the corridors in search of some
acquaintance whose education was broader than
her own, and finally she chanced upon Lieutenant
Jermyn, who had been visiting an invalid
friend.</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Jermyn, you can read writin', can't
you?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes, Trixy, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Then won't you tell me what's on the back
of this picture?"</p>

<p>Jermyn read aloud: "My dear little girl, I am
very fond of you, and I shall be glad to have
you carry my picture on your journey with you,
so that I may be brought to your mind once in
awhile. Yours sincerely, <span class="smcap">Harry Trewman</span>."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad he sent it!" exclaimed
Trixy. Jermyn smiled and replied:</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Miss Trixy, you're beginning
quite early to be interested in young men."</p>

<p>"You're the second person who's made that
mistake," Trixy replied. "The picture isn't for
me; it's for Aunt Fee."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Jermyn looked grave a moment
or two before he continued, "Wouldn't it
be better, then, for you not to show it to people
in general?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to. I only wanted to
know what the writin' was about."</p>

<p>"Suppose you put it into the envelope," suggested
Jermyn, "and take it to your aunt's
room."</p>

<p>"Just what I was goin' to do," said Trixy.
"Isn't it funny that both of us thought of the
same thing?"</p>

<p>Jermyn admitted that it was, although he was
oppressively silent as he walked through the
hall&mdash;he who had always told Trixy some funny
story when he met her.</p>

<p>Fenie had learned to like Jermyn greatly during
their short acquaintance, but on the evening
that followed the picture incident he surpassed
himself in deference, humor and brilliancy. Fenie
did not wonder that Trif had always remembered
him pleasantly. She did wish he was not
quite so old; a man of thirty-five seems dreadfully
ancient to a girl of twenty. Still, soldiers
were splendid anyway. Of course, he did not
care particularly for her, for he had never seen
her until that week, but there was something in
his voice and manner on this particular evening
that affected her strangely. Could it be that he
was falling in love with her? If so, she&mdash;she
really ought to feel sorry.</p>

<p>But was she? She could scarcely believe so;
she would examine her mind seriously when the
evening ended; perhaps she would speak to
Trif about it. There was nothing between her
and Harry Trewman&mdash;she could honestly say
that, and perhaps&mdash;perhaps she had acted very
foolishly about that young man. Harry was a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>

fine fellow, as young men go, but how plain he
appeared, to her mind's eye, beside the handsome
soldier who scarcely left her side that
evening!</p>

<p>By the time the evening ended the young
woman had a head full of pleasing fancies
marred only by a weak compunction of conscience.
She sat in Trif's room a few minutes,
chatting with her sister about people whom
they had met during the day, and admiring
Trixy, who was always a charming picture when
asleep. Then she passed into her own room;
in a moment Trif heard a sharp exclamation,
and Fenie stood in the doorway between the
rooms, gasping:</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"Of what? Oh, my sister, you're looking
like a ghost!"</p>

<p>"I feel as if I had seen one. Why did you
do it? What have I done to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tryphena Wardlow, what are you talking
about?" asked Trif, approaching the girl. "Do
say something intelligible, if you can, and stop
acting."</p>

<p>For answer, Fenie took her sister's hand and
led the way to the mirror, between the glass and
frame of which was a photograph of Harry
Trewman.</p>

<p>"In the name of all that's mysterious," exclaimed
Trif, "where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Where, indeed! Didn't you place it there,
to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I give you my word that I never saw it, or
knew of its existence, until this instant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, this is dreadful," exclaimed Fenie, sinking
into a chair. "There's some mystery about
it. Who can be here who knows anything
about&mdash;about what had happened? Who has
been able to get into our room without our
knowledge? I shan't dare to fall asleep. I
shan't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do stop being dramatic, Fee, and try to be
sensible. The picture didn't sneak in through
the keyhole, nor did invisible hands bring it,
although I confess that for the moment I'm
mystified. Oh, I have it! Mark my words,
Trixy knows something about that picture."</p>

<p>In an instant Fenie was in the adjoining
room and shaking Trixy. The child was sleeping
as soundly as ocean air and the lullaby of
gentle surf can make children sleep, but Fenie
persevered.</p>

<p>"Picture?&mdash;in your lookin' glass?" the child
drawled. "Oh, yes; I put it there. That was
the s'prise&mdash;that I wouldn't&mdash;tell you all about.
Did it s'prise you&mdash;lots?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. But how did you get it?"</p>

<p>Trixy was falling asleep again, and her mother
insisted that further explanation should be deferred
until morning. As Fenie took the picture
from the mirror she saw the inscription and
read it. Then Bruce Jermyn went out of her
mind and a joyous feeling took his place.</p>

<span class="small">ALL BY CHANCE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">"I'VE found out all about them," said Kate
Trewman to her brother, a day or two after
Trif, Trixy and Fenie had gone South. "They've
gone to Florida, for Trixy's health."</p>

<p>"Who have gone to Florida?" asked Harry,
trying to appear indifferent.</p>

<p>"Whom do you suppose I mean? Mrs. Highwood,
and Trixy, and Fenie. That child is the
apple of their eye. Still, I'm inclined to think
that Fenie herself wanted to get away for a
while. I'm sure if I'd been in her place I'd
have wanted to, had I known that certain other
people knew certain things."</p>

<p>"What people? What things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be silly."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I've been thinking of going
South myself&mdash;oh, no; not to Florida. Our firm
have a little business at Norfolk that requires
personal attention, and they want me to attend
to it. Don't you want to go with me? Old
Point Comfort is within an hour's sail of Norfolk,
and our friends, the Braymans, went down
there yesterday, to remain a week, and there's a
big fort there, full of officers, who are said to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>

work harder and enjoy their leisure better than
any other men in the United States."</p>

<p>"We go," said Kate, and go they did, the very
next day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in entire ignorance of what some
of their acquaintances were doing, Trif and
Fenie found some small shopping necessary; the
nearest shopping centre to Old Point was Norfolk.
So one morning to Norfolk they went,
taking Trixy with them.</p>

<p>Grown people's shopping is very tiresome
business to little people, so Trixy became so
uncomfortable that she begged to be allowed to
rest by standing upon the sidewalk and looking
at the passers-by, and Trif permitted it, stipulating
that the child should not go further from
the store than the street at either side.</p>

<p>The child soon found herself having a delightful
time, and storing her mental picture book
with unfamiliar scenes, when suddenly she
shouted, "Hooray!"</p>

<p>Then she dashed across the street, and with
one hand pulled the frock of Kate Trewman,
while with the other she grasped Harry's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Trixy Highwood! Did you drop down
from the sky?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose I did," said Trixy, after a moment
of thought, "but that was seven years ago.
To-day, though, I dropped over here from Old
Point Comfort."</p>

<p>"But how do you come to be roaming the
streets of Norfolk?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"I ain't roamin'. I can't go off of this block,
'cause mamma and Aunt Fee are in the store
there, buyin' things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"But we thought you'd gone to Florida?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we're goin' there one of these days, I
s'pose, 'cause that's where we started for; but
mamma says it's hard to get away from Old
Point, because she keeps findin' old friends
there."</p>

<p>"Does Fenie find any?" discreetly asked
Kate.</p>

<p>"She doesn't need to," was the reply, "for she
keeps findin' new ones all the time. Say, army
officers is real nice; don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"So I've always heard," said Kate, while
Harry looked so unhappy that his sister pinched
him until he complained. Just then Trif came
out of the shop, wondering whether Trixy did
not need looking after; but she lost none of her
self-possession when she found herself face to
face with the Trewmans. Within five minutes
Trif had made the Trewmans promise to run
over to Old Point before they returned to New
York. She begged them, also, to return with
her to the shop, and surprise Fenie, but Harry
pleaded extreme haste&mdash;a matter of business,
he said.</p>

<p>"Still," said Kate, "we may yet surprise her
if you won't allude to us until you meet us at
Old Point."</p>

<p>"That will be splendid," exclaimed Trif, with
glowing cheeks; for she was thinking over the
scene with Harry's picture.</p>

<p>"Harry," said Kate, as soon as the party
separated, "you've no reason to worry."</p>

<p>"No reason!" echoed the young man. "I
think I've a lot of them. Don't you remember
what Trixy said about army officers?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure!" Then Kate lapsed into
silence.</p>

<p>"Trixy, dear," said Trif, before re-entering
the shop, "I want you now to be very, very
womanly. You mustn't say a word to Aunt Fee
about the people we've just met."</p>

<p>"I understand, mamma dear. Say, when's
Mr. Trewman and Aunt Fee goin' to be married?"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h&mdash;h! Perhaps never. Who put such
an idea into your mind?"</p>

<p>"Why, Bridget did&mdash;our servant, at home;
but I thought of it before, 'cause they act just
like the folks in the stories that you and Aunt
Fee read out loud to each other sometimes."</p>

<p>Trif looked despairing&mdash;almost desperate.
Her cautions must be intensified, so she continued.</p>

<p>"Remember, dear! Don't say a word about
the Trewmans to Aunt Fee when we return to
the shop. Don't mention them on the boat on
the way back. Don't mention them in the
hotel. Don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" interrupted Trixy. "What
an awful lot of dont's! I wish I didn't ever see
anythin', or hear anythin', or know anythin'."</p>

<p>"Poor, dear little girl," said Trif caressingly.
"Grown people sometimes have 'dont's,' and
have a lot of trouble with them, too."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" the child asked. "Do you
ever have to put cotton in your ears, or bite
your tongue?"</p>

<p>"You afflicted darling," exclaimed Trif, her
maternal instinct fully aroused. Was her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>

precious darling to be physically afflicted
through affairs in which she had no part?&mdash;suffer
for other people's affairs, for which she
was not in any way responsible? No, indeed.
She would give Fenie a lecture, and at once,
which would do that young woman much good
and save an innocent little girl from further
torment. Fenie should learn to hold her own
tongue; it was she who did most of the talking
which poor little Trixy was obliged to hear&mdash;how
could the child help hearing it? Sisterly
affection was quite right; Trif had long tried to
be sister and mother too to her pretty, darling
sister, but should a child suffer for an adult,&mdash;the
weak for the strong? Not while the weak,
the child, was Trif's own, only daughter. Trixy
should have no more trouble about the affairs
of other people.</p>

<p>Full of this determination, Trif returned to
the shop with an air so resolute and aggressive
that the clerks shrank in terror and wondered
what complaint was about to be made. She
strode like a pictured goddess to where Fenie
was idly wondering which of two patterns of
insertion to buy; she turned her sister toward
her and exclaimed, softly yet tragically:</p>

<p>"Tryphena, I must ask you to keep your
affairs to yourself hereafter, except at such times
as you and I are alone together. This poor
child mustn't be tormented with them any
longer. She&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Trixy, "I've got to bite my
tongue a lot more now, 'cause I just saw&mdash;oh,
mamma, please don't pinch me so hard!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you see, Trixy?" asked Fenie.</p>

<p>"That piece of insertion you have in your
hand&mdash;" said Trif quickly. "Trixy, dear, go
back to the door, if you like&mdash;that piece of insertion,
as I was saying, is just what I would
get if I were you, for&mdash;" and the remaining
conversation was closely restricted to garments,
although Fenie looked somewhat indignant and
curious.</p>

<p>The evening chanced to be one of the most
delightful that had ever blessed Old Point. The
sky was clear, the air warm yet invigorating;
the music was of the best, the guests were in
the best of humor with one another, and everything
went as merrily as the traditional marriage
bell.</p>

<p>Best of all, to one small person. Trixy had
received permission to remain with the older
people until nine o'clock, for she had complained
that the nine o'clock gun at the fort always woke
her, and Trif thought it a shame that the dear
child had to be roused from sleep in a strange
place, where she was alone, and Fenie said she
was quite willing to sit beside Trixy's bed until
the dear child fell asleep, and Trif did not dare
to admit that her one consuming desire was
that Fenie and Trixy should not be alone
together a single instant until&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So Trixy remained up and awake, and Trif
had no more thought of it than if she had been
an inhabitant of another planet and without any
right or title to a little girl who sat or stood near
her all the while, as mute as a mouse, and also
as observant. Bless congenial company! What

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>

wonders has it not wrought for tired men and
women? Trif had not imagined herself tired
when she started for the South, but woman's
work is never done while woman is at home.
So when she finds herself so far from it that
she cannot by any possibility attend to it, yet
can drop it from her mind, how she does
enjoy the chat of other good women similarly
situated!</p>

<p>As to Fenie, she was the centre of a little group
of officers from the fort. Her sister was with
her, and, although to some of the party the older
sister was the more interesting of the two, she
who was the younger and unmarried, assumed
all the admiration was as entirely for her as if
there were no other women at Old Point. Those
officers did say such clever and delightful things!
As to that, so did two or three civilians who joined
the party, but there was something about a uniform
that&mdash;oh, Fenie couldn't explain it, but
she was sure that any other girl in similar circumstances
would understand exactly what she
meant.</p>

<p>Besides, was there not in the edge of the mirror
the photograph of a man to whom her heart
was entirely loyal, although no allegiance had
ever been demanded? Others might be men,
but he&mdash;he was Harry Trewman, the only man
she had ever&mdash;no, not the only man she had
ever loved, for she could not truly say, as yet,
that she really loved Harry.</p>

<p>Just as some one had told a very amusing
story, and Fenie had laughed heartily at it, and
begun to tell a story of which the first had reminded
her, she stopped and turned pale. Her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>

sister wondered what was the matter, and soon
learned, for, through the parlor, on the way to
one of the corridors, and preceded by a porter
with bags and wraps, came Harry Trewman and
Kate. Fenie moved from the circle&mdash;moved as
if she were in a dream. She extended her hand
to Harry, who took it gravely, respectfully, for a
fraction of a second, and then hurried after his
sable guide. Fenie dropped back to her chair,
resumed the story she had been telling, and completed
it with such a mass of detail that, when
finally the party broke up, one of the junior officers
told a comrade that Miss Wardlow had
evidently met her fate, and met him that very
evening, too.</p>

<p>It was Fenie who broke up the party, for she
was sure Trixy ought to be in bed&mdash;was it not
after ten o'clock? No, indeed; Trif should not
take the child to the room; hadn't she herself
promised to look carefully after the dear little
invalid?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Trif herself was in the room
within a few minutes. She found Trixy in bed,
and Fenie kneeling beside her, and Trixy was
talking, and Trif did not like to interrupt, because
sometimes Trixy said things so odd that her
mother liked to hear without seeming to notice.</p>

<p>"Trixy, Trixy," Fenie had just said. "It is
very late, and you must be very sleepy. Don't
you think you can drop off now?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;s'pose so," the child drawled, "but there
was somethin' I wanted to ask you. Let me
see; what was it? Oh!" and Trixy sprang up
and suddenly became very wide awake. "Say,
Aunt Fee, did lookin' at him make you well?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looking at whom, Trixy? I'm not ill, child?"</p>

<p>"Why, papa said a look at Harry Trewman's
face was the best medicine you could have."</p>

<p>Fenie burst into tears, upon which Trif hurried
to her, but Fenie continued to weep, and
for so long that Trif wept too, after which Trixy
sobbed pitifully.</p>

<p>"Papa said it, and she's had the look, and it
ain't done her no good, for she's cryin' like ev'rythin',
and I worked so hard to give it to her, and
gave up a dolly to get it, and then he came himself,
and that made her cry more than ever."</p>

<p>"Oh, Trif," exclaimed Fenie. "He met me
so coldly&mdash;and after what he wrote on his picture,
too! Do you suppose he was jealous of the
company he saw me in?"</p>

<p>"Did Harry write you somethin' on a picture,
Aunt Fee?" asked Trixy.</p>

<p>"Yes, he&mdash;; but you mustn't ask questions
about things that don't concern you, Trixy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't, but I just wanted to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you mustn't want to know what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h&mdash;!" Don't ever mention the subject
to me again. Promise me, this instant!"</p>

<p>"Sister," protested Trif, "you don't yet know
how that picture came to you."</p>

<p>I don't want to know anything about the picture,
or him, or about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I shan't tell you, or ask you, or anythin',"
said Trixy, with a sob that would have
softened any heart but that of a young woman
who thought she had been treated coldly by the
man whom she thought she might learn to love.</p>

<span class="small">MORE REVELATIONS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Harry Trewman reached his room
he dropped into a chair and a very dismal
frame of mind, which his face reflected, for
when his sister looked in upon him a few minutes
later she said:</p>

<p>"Why, brother! What is the matter with
you? From your melancholy appearance one
would suppose you hadn't just reached Old
Point and its chief attraction."</p>

<p>"Attraction, indeed," moaned Harry. "I suspect
I am a fool, for it never before occurred to
me that a young woman whom I think the sum
total of everything good and charming, might
appear equally attractive to other men. Did
you see the crowd about her?&mdash;the uniforms and
buttons?&mdash;and how she seemed to be enjoying
herself? Still, she has the right to do entirely
as she likes; I've no claim upon her."</p>

<p>"My dear Harry," said Kate tenderly, as she
seated herself on the arm of Harry's easy chair,
"don't be foolish. Do you suppose that a girl
is going to lose interest in everything and everybody
in the world because she likes a certain
young man, or because a certain young man
likes her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. But she seemed to be enjoying herself
so hugely. I never saw her so radiant."</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't she have enjoyed herself?
I'm sure that I'd have done the same had I been
in her place. I envy her the chance of talking
with a lot of clever men. Do you think I would
refuse it even if I were deeply in love with some
one?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not; but that would be different."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a very decided young woman,
with opinions of your own, while&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Every woman should be as you say I am
if she would have men respect her. But, Harry,
what fine fellows those soldiers are! They look
as if they had minds of their own, and if there's
anything that a woman specially likes in a man,
it is that."</p>

<p>"Umph! I suppose you mean that young
men who aren't soldiers haven't minds of their
own&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Harry, I think your own mind needs additional
strength at once, which it may get from
sleep. Go to bed. Good night. Sleep well."</p>

<p>Kate herself remained awake a long time,
thinking about her brother's prospects, for she
had been half in love several times, and been
rescued by the discovery that some other man
who seemed to admire her was more interesting
than the man she thought herself specially fond
of. She loved her brother dearly, but Harry
was still young and boyish&mdash;none too much so,
to be sure, for Fenie Wardlow, but how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
more interesting those officers were! Her knowledge
of them had been obtained during the
several minutes in which she had sat at one end
of the great parlor while Harry had been registering
their names at the office and arranging
for rooms, but she was a young woman who
reached conclusions rapidly.</p>

<p>Like most other people who lie awake late to
think, Kate awoke early. She peeped through
the window blinds, inhaled the fresh air, and
wished herself out of doors. Dressing quickly
she went upon the verandah. The sky was clear,
the air balmy, and the surf rippling brilliantly
and murmurously on the beach. Kate noted all
this and keenly enjoyed it. Then she chanced
to see, on the higher and drier sands, almost at
her feet, a large straw hat under which was a
small frock, two little hands and a shovel. The
little figure's back was toward her, but the figure's
voice was high in air, and it was singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Half a dozen dolls;</span>
<span class="i2">Half a dozen dolls;</span>
<span class="i4">Half a dozen,</span>
<span class="i4">Half a dozen,</span>
<span class="i2">Half a dozen dolls.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"'Tis Trixy Highwood!" exclaimed Kate to
herself, and she hastily descended to the beach
and Trixy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Trewman," shouted Trixy when
she saw Kate, "don't you like to dig wells? It's
awful fun. I've got this one nearly deep enough
for the water to come in; as soon as it's done
I'll lend you my shovel and you can dig one.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

Whoever digs the best one any day gets a five-cent
piece from the Admiral&mdash;he comes around
and looks at 'em ev'ry day. I won't mind if
yours is better than mine and gets the prize."</p>

<p>Kate had no intention to take part in competitive
well-digging, but she was glad to do anything
that would give her sufficient excuse to be
with Trixy a little while; so as there was not
another person in sight except one of the hotel
watchmen, she stretched herself upon the warm,
dry sand, took Trixy's shovel, and began to dig.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you came down," said Trixy.
"Ev'rybody here sleeps so late, that it's lonesome
on the beach in the mornin'. The sunrise gun
always wakes me, and when I dress, mamma lets
me out of the room if I promise to go back and
wake her at 8 o'clock. It's fun to run up and
down on the beach, and dig wells, and find pretty
stones."</p>

<p>"Is it always so quiet as this in the morning?"
Kate asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; there's scarcely anybody here,
even as late as mamma comes down. Lots of
folks don't eat breakfast until noon-time; how
do you s'pose they manage to wait? Say; why
didn't you make your brother come down and
dig a well? Mamma says he looks as if he
needed exercise."</p>

<p>"H'm! Really I hadn't thought of it."</p>

<p>"He does need exercise, though, don't he?
But of course he does, if mamma says so. Besides,
he looks real white. All the men here look
kinder red and brown, 'specially the officers."</p>

<p>"You seem very observant of men, little girl&mdash;and
of officers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I am, 'cause I like 'em. Mamma
likes 'em, too, and so does Aunt Fee, I guess,
'cause they're all the time talkin' to her, and
walkin' on the piazza and the beach with her."</p>

<p>"They? Then there are more than one?"</p>

<p>"Gracious, yes! There's about forty here,
Lieutenant Jermyn says."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Jermyn? Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He's the first one I met, and he used to know
mamma very well, and he's ever so nice to me,
and he don't seem to know how to keep away
from Aunt Fee&mdash;so I heard a lady say."</p>

<p>"Indeed." Kate continued digging a moment
or two longer, for she wanted to think. Besides,
the warm sea air was working its witchery with
her, and disinclining her to effort. The sand
was clean, she and Trixy were still the only
occupants of the beach, so Kate soon sank
entirely upon the warm white couch which old
Ocean had provided for those who chose to
recline upon it.</p>

<p>The sun was bright and she was without veil
or parasol, but she could trust her complexion to
itself for a few moments. There were so few
times and places for a young woman out of
doors! How delightful it would be, she thought,
if somewhere near New York there was a great,
clean, safe beach to lounge upon! The mere act
of breathing seemed a positive pleasure. The
sunlight, through her closed eyelids, became a
delightful immensity of rosy pink, the ripple of
the wavelets upon the beach was ideal music,
the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Trixy who spoke, from not three feet
away, but Kate pretended not to hear; she preferred
the companionship of her own thoughts,
although everything definite had escaped from
them. The next sound she heard caused her to
rise hastily on one elbow, for it seemed that there
was a noise in the sand unlike that made by
Trixy's shovel.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Jermyn. Don't you know Miss
Trewman? She's one of mamma's and Aunt
Fee's friends."</p>

<p>"Don't arise, please," said Jermyn with a bow
while Kate looked uncomfortable. "I'm glad
to see that Trixy isn't the only visitor who has
learned which is the most delightful hour of
the day down here."</p>

<p>Kate persisted in arising, and Jermyn made
haste to bring her a chair; then he talked
well-digging in a matter-of-fact way with Trixy,
and smiled, with Kate, at some of the child's
replies, and so succeeded quickly in dispelling
Kate's sense of embarrassment. Still more,
wasn't he the very officer Kate had most noticed
during her several minutes' survey the
night before?</p>

<p>"You ought to like him lots, Miss Trewman,"
said Trixy suddenly, with the air of having
recalled something from the limbo of forgetfulness,
"'cause he likes Aunt Fee lots."</p>

<p>"And Aunt Fee's sister, too," added Jermyn,
without change of countenance. "I had the
pleasure of meeting Mrs. Highwood frequently,
some years ago, when my battery was stationed
at New York."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"How pleasant," said Kate, although she did
not mean it. Again she wondered whether
there might not have been deep purpose in
that Florida trip which seemed to have ended
at Fort Monroe. Something ought to be done,
and at once, if it were not already too late.
What should it be? Thinking was not easy,
under the circumstances, for Jermyn was talking
to her&mdash;not persistently, or as a man who was
trying to flirt; and she liked his looks so much
that she did not want to appear inattentive,
although, really, didn't it seem utterly dreadful
to be chatting before seven in the morning with
a man who had been introduced only by a little
girl?</p>

<p>As they talked, Kate resolved upon a plan of
action. Fenie should become her sister-in-law
if she, Kate, could manage it. Dear Harry
should not be disappointed; Fenie was too
young to marry a man like Lieutenant Jermyn.
If Jermyn's attention could by any possibility
be diverted from Fenie, she, Kate, would divert
it; the result might be a heartache for herself,
for she did most heartily admire such men.
Still, she would endure such a pain, for her dear
brother's sake, and if, after all, the affair
didn't end in a heartache, why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Just here she blushed, although Jermyn
couldn't imagine why, for at that very instant
he was explaining, at Kate's request, why the
fort on the Rip-Raps, a couple of miles away,
had not been completed, and he could not
imagine what there was in the subject, or in
his description, to bring a blush to any cheek,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>

yet he said to himself that the blush was very
becoming, and that Miss Trewman was quite
an interesting young woman.</p>

<p>The chat continued until Trixy, who had
once in ten minutes asked Jermyn the time,
announced that she must go to wake her
mother for breakfast. This reminded Kate
that she had a brother to rouse, so she and the
child went into the house.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, while Trif and Fenie and
Trixy with Jermyn, whom they had invited to
breakfast with them, were chatting over their
morning meal the head waiter brought Harry
and Kate to the same table. There was no
help for it, although Harry looked as if he
wished there were; a head waiter is autocrat of
his domain. As to the others, Trif exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How delightful!" Fenie smiled pleasantly,
although with some embarrassment, while Trixy
shouted:</p>

<p>"Hooray!"</p>

<p>Kate bravely began operations at once. Fortune,
in the guise of the waiter, had placed her
beside Jermyn and Harry beside Fenie, so, Kate
argued, if she were to monopolize the officer,
Harry and Fenie would be obliged to talk to
each other, and she was old enough to know
that compulsory conversation has frequently
broken the thickest of social ice.</p>

<p>The plan worked finely. Harry and Fenie were
obliged to talk to each other, for no one else spoke
to either, and as each was determined that the
other shouldn't think anything unusual the
matter, each quickly became voluble and merry.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

Bless the transparency of youthful hypocrisy.
Neither of those two young people imagined
that any one was noticing them, yet Kate's
heart was dancing with joy as she saw them
frankly exchange tender looks, and Trif's mind
lost a great weight so rapidly that she felt
several years younger within half an hour, and
she was made still happier when, as the entire
party strolled toward the fort to see "guard
mount," Jermyn had occasion to whisper to her:</p>

<p>"Mr. Trewman is a remarkably fortunate
young man&mdash;bless him."</p>

<p>Guard mounting in the army is quite as ceremonious
a matter as parade, and Jermyn had to
answer many questions which Kate put in rapid
succession, while Fenie, who had seen guard
mount several times, explained everything to
Harry. Trixy seemed interested only in the
movements of a dog, which persisted in following
every movement of the post band. Her
mother gazed at her in adoration. How entirely
the dear child seemed absorbed in whatever
interested her&mdash;how oblivious to everything else!</p>

<p>When the ceremony ended, and the little
crowd under the live-oak trees broke up, Fenie
and Harry, Kate and Jermyn, began to move
slowly toward the hotel, while Trif and Trixy
walked behind them. Suddenly, while no one
else was talking, Trixy remarked:</p>

<p>"Mamma, dear; wouldn't it be nice if they
all got married, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Kate suddenly asked Jermyn why it was that
so large a fort had only a single flag-staff, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>

Harry hastened to give Fenie the details of a
lumber contract concerning which he had come
South, and Fenie listened as intently as if she
knew lumber from timber, or any other commodity.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<span class="small">A SNATCH AT TIME'S FORELOCK.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">BETWEEN the exhilarating effects of the
breakfast-table chat with Fenie, and the
furtive, embarrassed, yet roguish look which
Fenie had worn for a fraction of a second, when
Trixy had made her unexpected remark in the
fort about marriage, Harry Trewman was the
happiest youth in the State of Virginia.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he did not forget his business
duties or his business training. The lumber
case at Norfolk had disturbed his dreams at
night, and was now troubling his day-dreams;
the best way to avoid any more annoyance was
to hurry over to Norfolk and settle the business
at once.</p>

<p>Besides, now seemed the proper time to come
to a definite understanding with Fenie&mdash;an
understanding of the kind frequently completed
by the presentation of a ring containing a stone,
preferably a diamond. Harry had seen in a
Norfolk shop a ring, which he thought would
entirely answer the purpose, and he would buy
it that very morning. Before he started, however,
he took the precaution to beg his sister,
half shamefacedly, to keep all designing bachelors
from Fenie for a few hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trust me for that," said Kate, in her most
earnest manner. "I shall keep Fenie under my
own wing to-day; I shall make sure, at least, that
Lieutenant Jermyn doesn't injure any of your
chances."</p>

<p>Kate was as good as her word, and as she and
Fenie were really very fond of each other, they
were together all morning. Trixy was with
them; her honest little heart was still full of the
injunction to take the best of care of her Aunt
Fee, but the child found little to do but sit still
and listen. The two young women talked as
freely and incessantly as any other couple of old
acquaintances, amid scenes entirely new, and
with plenty of time at their disposal, and Trixy
heard much that set her to thinking; but she
had so often been cautioned against asking
questions, since she had been at Old Point,
that she found it necessary to think out her
puzzles for herself.</p>

<p>Kate's principal cause of fear, also her principal
object of admiration, Lieutenant Jermyn, did
not reappear during the morning, and Kate was
mystified, as well as somewhat troubled. Was it
possible that he preferred to chat with Fenie only
while her sister was present&mdash;or when he could
find her alone? If so, matters were more serious
than Kate had thought. Perhaps&mdash;but, pshaw!&mdash;Kate
rebuked herself with an indignant blush,
for the thought that perhaps Jermyn might
desire to chat with Kate herself, and preferred
not to talk to two young women at once.</p>

<p>Yet she continued to wonder. Like most
other young women, and, indeed, like all Americans

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>

not well acquainted with the army, she was
of the impression that officers had nothing to
do, while not on parade, but make themselves
pleasing to the general eye, and to young women
in particular. She did not know that most of
the officers at Fort Monroe were either instructors
or students at a most exacting post-graduate
school of artillery, where each was expected to
impart or receive such advanced knowledge as
would suffice the commandant of a great fort or
the chief of artillery of an army.</p>

<p>As Kate wondered, and feared, and imagined
it occurred to her that the most sensible course
would be to "draw out" Fenie. She felt toward
the girl as any young person feels toward
one several years younger; she had a sense of
condescension and tolerance which was not always
under good control. Fenie was young, so
she was artless, unsuspecting, and transparent.
What would be easier than to learn from her,
not for curiosity's sake, but for Harry's and
Fenie's own, all that there might be between her
and Lieutenant Jermyn?</p>

<p>So, as the two girls finally seated themselves
on the piazza to look at the noonday promenaders,
Kate asked suddenly:</p>

<p>"What becomes of all the men here in the
middle of the day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are somewhere with one another, I
suppose," replied Fenie. "Men are very interesting
to one another, don't you think so?
There's a club in the fort to which many of them
go, I believe."</p>

<p>"Probably those who aren't soldiers go there

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

to meet those who are," said Kate. "What fine
men those army officers seem to be! I've seen
them only at long range&mdash;I believe that's a military
expression, isn't it?&mdash;but they seem so manly
and self-possessed; so unlike the little fellows
who pass for men in New York."</p>

<p>"Trif," said Fenie, "has often insisted that
soldiers have learned the secret of never growing
old, and she seems to be right. From the
youngest to the oldest, I've found them courteous,
agreeable and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deferential?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that is just the word. There's nothing
consequential or silly about them, as there is
about so many young men and old beaux at
home."</p>

<p>"You lucky girl!" exclaimed Kate. "I wonder
that your good fortune in meeting such
clever fellows hasn't turned your head."</p>

<p>Fenie indulged in a smile that Kate thought
quite unusual in a girl so young, a smile which
was almost grim, as she replied:</p>

<p>"There's a saying in the family that the Wardlow
head never gets entirely off the Wardlow
shoulders, and I'm trying to live up to it. Still,
I've enjoyed myself greatly in the general company
here."</p>

<p>"General company? No man in particular?
What a lot of girls whom we both know, would
give their heads for your chance. Do you know,
Fenie dear, I wouldn't have wondered if by this
time you had lost your heart to some one quite
competent to care for it."</p>

<p>Fenie looked so astonished, and also so hurt,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>

that Kate called herself a brute. Evidently
Harry was safe; the assurance was so exhilarating
that Kate lost her own head for a moment
or two and began to talk at random.</p>

<p>"What a capital fellow Lieutenant Jermyn is!"
she said. "Do you know, it was merely Trixy
who introduced him to me, yet he at once made
me feel entirely at ease with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's charming," replied Fenie. "He's
been very kind to Trif and me. He seems to
know every one, and he's made us acquainted
with many pleasant people. Indeed, I suppose
that is the reason Trif is not with us now; she
probably is chatting with people whom Jermyn
has introduced."</p>

<p>"What a social paragon he must be! I wish
he were here now, for I want to ask questions
about scores of people whom I am meeting."</p>

<p>"The Admiral could answer them, and quite
as well, if he were here," said Fenie innocently.</p>

<p>"The Admiral?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Then Fenie began to tell what a delightful
gentleman the old Admiral was. In the
meantime Trixy was looking about for the Admiral
himself, for it was about the time for the
daily inspection of sand-wells and the award of
the prize. But Trixy could not see the genial
old man anywhere, although she strolled the entire
length of the piazza, and then went into the
office to ask questions. The Admiral had gone
to the club, in the fort, some one said. Well,
the fort was but two or three hundred steps
away, Trixy knew, for she had been there several
times already. She knew, too, where the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

club was, for Lieutenant Jermyn had taken
her there to show her the picture of a distant relation
of her mother who had been a soldier.</p>

<p>To the club Trixy went, but an elderly officer
whom she met said that the Admiral was not
there.</p>

<p>"That's too bad," said Trixy, "'cause some
ladies wants him."</p>

<p>Another elderly officer, who was present, admitted
that it certainly was too bad, and said
that the Admiral would be greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>"Mebbe," said Trixy, a happy thought coming
to her mind, "mebbe Lieutenant Jermyn is
here."</p>

<p>"He is in one of the section rooms," replied
one of the officers.</p>

<p>"He's saying his lessons," added the other
"Do you ever have lessons, little girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," sighed Trixy. "Some of 'em's
awful hard, too, though mamma helps me all
she can. But do you mean that a great big man
like Lieutenant Jermyn goes to school?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the child. Then she
thought a moment, and continued:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose his teacher would let him
out for a while? Other scholars get let out of
school sometimes, when somebody needs to see
them very much."</p>

<p>"I think it doubtful," said one of the officers,
but the other, with a wink at his companion, said:</p>

<p>"One never knows what can be done until one
has tried. Just go over to that door where you
see a cat sitting, ask for the teacher, and tell him
what you want."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said Trixy, trotting briskly in
the direction indicated, while one officer said to
the other:</p>

<p>"Colonel, when will you outgrow your fondness
for practical jokes?"</p>

<p>"Not while I live, I hope. Besides, where's
the harm? Amperthwaite, the instructor of that
section, will be cleverer for the remainder of the
day, after such an interruption, and the boys will
be glad of a moment's truce. I wish I could be
there to see and listen."</p>

<p>The door was open, and Jermyn was standing
in front of a large blackboard covered with
marks which reminded Trixy of the geometrical
puzzles which her father sometimes cut from
cardboard for her. The instructors and the other
officers were looking at the board, and Jermyn
was talking, so no one noticed the little girl in
the doorway, and Trixy was beginning to feel
embarrassed. Suddenly an officer, who had children
of his own, attracted attention by coughing
violently. Every one looked at him, and he, in
turn, looked toward the door.</p>

<p>"Are you the teacher of this school?" asked
Trixy of the one officer who sat apart from the
others.</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh&mdash;yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Jermyn, one of your scholars?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;Mr. Jermyn, do you resent the implication?"</p>

<p>"Not for an instant, Captain."</p>

<p>"Well, little girl, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only if you'd let him out, there's a couple
of ladies who'd like to see him very much; I
know they would, because one of them said so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The only really young lieutenant in the room
giggled; the others smiled, and the instructor,
after regarding the blackboard intently a moment,
said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Jermyn, you may consider yourself excused,
if you so desire."</p>

<p>Jermyn emerged with his cap in his hand and
more than his customary color in his face.
Trixy took his hand, and led him toward the
exit nearest the hotel. Looking towards the
club, she saw the two officers whom she had met,
they having moved their chairs nearer the door
that they might observe the proceedings, so she
shouted:</p>

<p>"I got him!"</p>

<p>Then each warrior chuckled, although Trixy
did not know it, for she was busily explaining to
Jermyn why she had come for him, and how hard
she had first tried to find the Admiral, and Jermyn
told her not to feel the least concern about
the interruption, although at the same time he
told himself in entire earnest that he wished
that Tryphosa Wardlow had never married and
become the mother of a child like Trixy, for
when would he ever hear the end of the section-room
episode?</p>

<p>But Trixy knew nothing of the trouble which
she had caused. She prattled without ceasing
until she had conducted the officer to her aunt
and Miss Trewman, to whom she said:</p>

<p>"Here he is. Now, ask him your questions."</p>

<p>Jermyn soon ceased to feel provoked. One of
the duties of a soldier is to endure anything that
may lead to desirable ends. It, therefore, came

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>

to pass within an hour that Jermyn assured himself
that to make himself interesting and useful
to two young women like Kate and Fenie was
sufficient compensation for any teasing which
his comrades might impose in the future. His
feelings must have expressed themselves in his
face, for a lull in the conversation was improved
by Trixy, who said:</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Jermyn, ain't you glad that I asked
your teacher to let you out of school?"</p>

<p>Then Jermyn had to explain; so did Trixy,
and the ladies had to feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<span class="small">MISPLACED CONFIDENCE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">KATE came within a day or two to enjoy the
society of Lieutenant Jermyn so much
that she did not hesitate to say so plainly to
Fenie. True, she said it half as a test, to be
applied to Fenie's own feelings, but as the girl
listened without a sign of jealousy, and even
looked pleased, Kate was so well satisfied with
the situation that she wanted to talk farther on
the subject, and with some one more competent
to estimate a mature man and gentleman at his
true value.</p>

<p>She therefore began to discuss Jermyn with
Trif, who was so happy over the change in Fenie's
manner that she was quite willing to rejoice and
sympathize with any one about anything. Like
any other good woman who had been compelled
to disappoint a good man, she wished she might
see the man made happy by some other good
woman, so she wondered whether a match between
Jermyn and Kate might not be possible.
Her own married life was so happy that she profoundly
pitied any other woman who was unmarried
yet old enough to know her own mind.</p>

<p>How Trif did long for Phil! If she could see
him, only for an hour, to consult with him

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>

about this new and delightful idea that had taken
possession of her.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly he would agree with her, for he
always came to her way of thinking, or she to his,
she was not sure which. She had half a mind to
telegraph him to run down to the fort for a day or
two; she was sure his horrid old firm would not
miss him greatly during so short an absence.
Then she thought it would be better to write
him and ask his advice.</p>

<p>Half wondering which course would be the
better, she began a letter, but was interrupted
again and again, so at night she was but little
further advanced than in the morning. Besides,
a series of showers had descended upon Old
Point, and Trixy was obliged to remain indoors,
and a little girl away from home on a showery
day is as restless as a guilty conscience, so Trif
finally called herself a heartless mother, and
tried to devote herself entirely to her child. Trixy
asked only that mamma would write a good
long letter for her to papa, and Trif began it,
and got well under way, when a waiter came to
the room with a message from Fenie, begging
Trif to come down at once to see some old
friends who had unexpectedly arrived, so poor
little Trixy was hurried to bed, where she
thought dismally of life's disappointments until
she fell asleep.</p>

<p>A little matter like a night's sleep could not
make Trixy forget anything upon which she had
set her heart. Early the next morning the child
begged her mamma to finish that letter to papa,
and she reverted to the subject several times

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

during the day. Finally she searched her
mother's portfolio for the unfinished letter, and
endeavored to complete it herself, in imitation
of print, which was the only sort of writing she
knew well. She had not learned to use a pen,
and the only pencil she could find had a very
bad point, so she put both letter and pencil
into her pocket, and resolved to bide her time
until she could find her mother disengaged.</p>

<p>Once upon the beach, and at her favorite
occupation of well-digging, she forgot the letter
for two or three hours, but the subject was
brought back to her mind by overhearing one of
the male guests tell another that he had just
received a letter from his little daughter, and
that a man never knew how dear his children
were until he was separated from them for a few
days.</p>

<p>Suddenly the inspector of sand-wells, the
cheery old Admiral, hove in view, and Trixy
hurried to him and asked:</p>

<p>"You can sharpen lead-pencils, can't you?"</p>

<p>"I could when I was at the Naval Academy,"
was the modest reply. In a moment Trixy's
hand and eyes and head and tongue were working
in unison, after the manner of beginners at
letter-writing, while the Admiral, standing a little
apart, pretended to write something in a memorandum
book, but really made a sketch, to be
presented to Trif, of the little correspondent as
she knelt upon the piazza floor and used a chair
as a desk.</p>

<p>"Writin's dreadful hard work," said Trixy,
after several moments of effort. "I do wish

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>

that mamma&mdash;oh, say, Admiral, you can write,
can't you? Of course you can&mdash;I see you doin'
it now. Won't you please finish this letter for
me if I tell you what to say? That's the way
mamma writes 'em for me&mdash;she begun this one.
If you do it you needn't pay me five cents the
next time my well's the best of the lot, and I
guess it's goin' to be the best to-day. Is it a
bargain?"</p>

<p>"But, Trixy," replied the Admiral, "I question
the propriety of hearing other peoples' family
affairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't write no family affairs. This is
only a letter to papa."</p>

<p>"Your logic, my dear, is as faultless as your
grammar. Still, I'll be your clerk for a few
moments."</p>

<p>"All right; I'm very much obliged. First,
though, you'd better begin and read what's
already wrote, 'cause it's so long since mamma
began this letter for me that I can't remember
what I told her to say."</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;let me see," said the Admiral, adjusting
his glasses. "'Dear Old Papa'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>The Admiral, who, like most men of affairs,
had acquired a way of reading a page at a glance,
suddenly looked at Trixy in astonishment. Then
he re-read the letter, and said, with a twinkle of
his eyes:</p>

<p>"Aren't you rather young to take so much
interest in match-making?"</p>

<p>"What's match-makin'?" asked the child,
with wondering eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you seem to understand the subject
very well. The idea of a child planning a marriage
between a man and a woman&mdash;quite suited
to each other though they certainly are&mdash;who
never met until this week!"</p>

<p>"Who do you mean? Aunt Fee and Harry?
Why, they've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I don't mean them. This is another
couple&mdash;a lady and an army officer."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean Mr. Jermyn and Miss Trewman?
Why, I don' remember tellin' mamma to
write anythin' about them. Come to think of
it, though, I said to her, over at guard mount
the other day, that 'twould be nice if they got
married; but she said 'Sh&mdash;h&mdash;,' and that means
the same thing as don't when mamma says it."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to be sure; it used to be so in our
family, when I was a boy. But how did this
subject get into the letter, if you didn't tell your
mother to write it?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, unless mamma put it
in just for fun. Sometimes she helps me with
things to say, when I want to write a real long
letter."</p>

<p>"H'm!" The Admiral looked very alert as
he recalled customs of his own family when he
was a young father. "Trixy, would you mind
telling me your father's name&mdash;his first name?"</p>

<p>"It's Philip."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. And is that what your mother
usually calls him?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, no! When she says 'Philip,'
papa pretends to be awfully scared. Sometimes
she calls him Phil, but usually she says 'papa.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just as I supposed." The Admiral was
silent and grave so long that the child timidly
asked:</p>

<p>"You don't think it's improper for her to do
it, do you?"</p>

<p>"Improper? No, indeed! I'd give half my
pay&mdash;yes, all of it&mdash;to hear my wife call me
'papa' again." Tears came into the veteran's
eyes, and Trixy, following home custom regarding
such matters, kissed them away, which
operation made the Admiral's face as cheery as
a sunburst. Nevertheless, the old man did some
more thinking, and finally he said:</p>

<p>"I'm such a stupid old fellow that I can't easily
finish what some other person has begun. Suppose
we destroy this letter, and I begin a new
one for you. I'll write one as long as you like,
if you'll come into the office, where I can find a
desk."</p>

<p>"Oh, good!"</p>

<p>"But about this one which your mother began&mdash;suppose
we have a secret about it?"</p>

<p>Trixy hesitated; she dearly loved a secret,
but of late her secrets had not been as well
kept as she would like. Still, she promised, and
the new letter was soon under way, and at the
top was written, "Dictated to Rear Admiral
Allison, retired, by Her Serene Highness the
Infanta Trixy." The Admiral put the original
and uncompleted letter into his pocket, intending
to burn it and destroy the ashes, although what
might happen, should there be any enquiries for
it, he was sure he did not know; perhaps it
might be well for him to hurry off to Washington,
or somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>When the new letter was completed Trixy
and the Admiral took it to the post-office, and
the old man, in endeavoring to impress upon
Trixy the advisability of keeping the matter a
secret while both of them remained at Old
Point, exerted his diplomatic faculties to an
extent unparalleled during his entire term of
service as an officer. He loathed the idea of
teaching duplicity to a child, but in the circumstances
it seemed entirely justifiable.</p>

<p>As the day waned, most of the ladies retired to
dress for dinner, and Trif, whose conscience had
been reproaching her all day for neglect of her
husband, to whom she knew her letters were
unspeakably welcome, and to whom she dearly
loved to write when she chanced to be away
from him, determined to finish the letter begun
the day before.</p>

<p>"Fenie," she soon said through the door between
the rooms, "have you been to my portfolio?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. I've done no writing."</p>

<p>"How strange. I'd begun a letter to Phil,
and now I can't find it."</p>

<p>Fenie said something playful about mislaid
affection, but Trif did not laugh, for she remembered
what she had written. Still, why should
she worry? No one but the chambermaid could
have been in the room, and she doubted whether
colored chambermaids at the South could read.
The letter would turn up in the course of time;
meanwhile she would write a hasty note to Phil
and enclose Trixy's, just as it was, in time for
the mail by the evening boat, which would close

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>

in a few minutes, and Trixy, who never was specially
dressed for dinner, could take the letter
down to the office.</p>

<p>The Admiral strolled over to the fort and the
club, where he met a semi-public man who was
talking to the Commandant about a promising
gold "placer" on the Pacific coast which had
proved so alluring that he had lost a lot of
money in trying to develop it. The Commandant
had known of this same placer, for he had
been stationed near it at one time; the Admiral
also had seen it, for he had been taken to it one
day by some men who had hoped to extract
some of his savings from him. Lack of water
was the trouble, and the Admiral, who had
looked carefully over the ground, had devised a
plan whereby water might be brought by a tortuous
route from a stream several miles distant.
When he said this to the semi-public man that
person replied:</p>

<p>"Give me your plan, and if it is practicable
you shall have a large block of stock, for nothing,
in the company I'll organize to work it."</p>

<p>The Admiral quickly took a letter from his
pocket and drew on the back of it a plan of the
country as he remembered it. Then he consulted
Jermyn, who had dropped into the club.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Jermyn, looking at the
sketch, "although it might be improved a little,
I think. I've done some shooting on that very
ground, so I remember it pretty well."</p>

<p>"How fortunate," said the Admiral. "Mr.
Blogsham, my friend Jermyn is a good engineer,
so he may be of more service than I."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" said Blogsham. "The better the
plan, the more it will be worth to us. There's a
block of stock for you too, Mr. Jermyn, if you
can make the water within reach."</p>

<p>Jermyn opened the sheet of paper and made
another sketch; then he turned the paper over,
supposing it might contain some memoranda on
the subject, but he saw something that so upset
his mind that in the next ten minutes he talked
so vaguely about the ground and the water that
his own chance of getting any stock in the proposed
mine seemed to him very small.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<span class="small">A SCRAP OF PAPER.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">BRUCE JERMYN was as honorable a gentleman
as could be found anywhere, but
for two or three days and nights he wished he
had read farther in that letter upon which he
and the Admiral had made their sketches of the
surroundings of the placer mine. No one knew
better than he the rights and sanctity of private
correspondence, but could any man be blamed
for wanting to know who it was who was planning
to marry him to Kate Trewman?</p>

<p>He could not say that he objected to the lady
named in the letter, but who could it be who
was charging herself with the conduct of the
affair? "Dear old Papa," the letter had begun,
and the Admiral being old, and also the possessor
of the letter, was undoubtedly the person
to whom it was addressed, but who could the
writer be? Jermyn knew that the Admiral had
at least one daughter, who was a clever woman
with some reputation in the service as a match-maker,
but she was married and living several
hundreds of miles from Old Point.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had arrived, an invalid, and
remained in her room; but it was strange that
no one mentioned her. Evidently the writer,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

whoever she might be&mdash;for the penmanship was
that of a woman&mdash;was acquainted with Kate
Trewman: in that case her identity might be
discovered through Kate, but Jermyn, manly
and honest though he was, half felt that he
would not again be able to look Kate fully in
the face, much less to interrogate her skilfully
on so delicate a subject, in which there seemed
so much at stake.</p>

<p>All his fears and doubts, however, disappeared
like mists before the sun when next he met Kate
herself. That estimable young woman was not
in the least forward, but she knew how to put
at their ease such men as she liked, and she
quickly made herself so companionable that
Jermyn began to wish that the writer of the
letter would go on match-making, and in the
greatest of earnest. Still, who on earth, or at
Old Point, could she be? The Admiral himself
seemed to enter entirely into the spirit of the
affair, for he made two or three occasions to
speak to Kate and Jermyn together, and to
bring out some of the young man's best points;
he was as hearty as if he and Jermyn had been
boys together, and that sort of thing, from an
officer of very high rank to a subaltern, has
its effect upon women. Indeed, the old sea-dog
was so very familiar that Jermyn almost
determined to boldly ask him for another
glance at the letter&mdash;at least, for a look at the
sketches.</p>

<p>But the Admiral's affability and high spirits
were partly assumed, for he had a great load of
trouble upon his mind. When he reached his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

room and prepared to burn the tell-tale letter, he
could not find the letter itself. What could he
have done with it? At times he was very
absent-minded; he had been known to go out
without his hat, and to search with his right hand
for the eye-glasses that were in his left, but he
certainly had carried that letter too close to his
mind to mislay it. Had he taken any papers
from his pocket anywhere? Ha! That sketch
of the placer mine.</p>

<p>He hurried back to the fort, but it was not
there, nor could he find anyone who had seen it.
Probably, the semi-public man, Blogsham, had
pocketed the paper, which would have been entirely
natural under the circumstances, but Blogsham
had already started for Washington.</p>

<p>The Admiral groaned. He remembered that
the letter had no signature, so it could not be
traced to its writer; but the writer was a woman,
and the subject was a woman and an officer, and
Blogsham was rather a coarse fellow, and very fond
of a practical joke, and if he should chance
to know Jermyn&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Know Jermyn? Why, to be sure he knew
him! Had not the Admiral himself introduced
the Lieutenant, and consulted him about the
sketch? Possibly Jermyn himself had the letter;
he would ask him. Hence, the Admiral's
frequent excuses to speak to Jermyn in Kate's
presence, and to finally ask bluntly:</p>

<p>"By the way, Jermyn, do you remember those
sketches we made at the club yesterday?"</p>

<p>The young officer suddenly reddened, and the
older officer lost heart, although he regained it
when Jermyn replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and I was going to ask you to let me
see them once more. Have you them with you?"</p>

<p>The Admiral looked the Lieutenant full in the
eye, at which the disappearing flush returned.
The Admiral continued:</p>

<p>"I supposed you had it already."</p>

<p>"Not I, I assure you. I left it upon the club
table, right at your elbow."</p>

<p>The Admiral suddenly looked so uncomfortable
that Jermyn said:</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope you haven't lost it!"</p>

<p>"So do I. I could make the sketch again
from memory, but there were some&mdash;er&mdash;some
memoranda on the other side of the sheet which
I had intended to preserve; that is, they were
not my property, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not your property?" Jermyn thought he
saw the opportunity for which he was longing.</p>

<p>"No. The letter itself belonged to another
person. Do you suppose that Blogsham himself
may have kept the sketches for future reference."</p>

<p>"Quite possibly. But Blogsham has returned
to Washington."</p>

<p>"So I have heard. I suppose there is nothing
left but to write him."</p>

<p>"What a lot of trouble a bit of paper may
cause," said Kate, becoming restive during a
conversation in which she had no part.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, indeed," replied the Admiral in a
manner so unlike any which Kate had previously
seen him display that the young woman began
to wonder whether there could be some historic
or romantic interest about the bit of paper in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

which the two men seemed so deeply interested.
Everything she had known about gentlemen of
the army and navy, until the last two or three
days, had been learned from novels and stories,
in many of which a bit of paper played an important
part. Perhaps there was some romance
even about this, and any romance of army and
navy would be very interesting to her&mdash;could
she know it.</p>

<p>An hour later Kate joined Trif and Fenie, with
whom sat Harry. Both ladies rallied her about
her apparent conquests in both warlike branches
of the public service, and Kate finally said that
she wished she often could make conquests of
such men as Admiral Allison and Lieutenant
Jermyn.</p>

<p>"And only think," she added; "I do believe
there's some great mystery between the two
men. 'Tis none of my affair, of course, but I
can't help being curious about it. 'Tis all about
some sketches and memoranda of some kind.
They talked it over before me without any
hesitation, but it was plain to see that there was
much more to it than appeared in the conversation."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Fenie, "there seems to be an
epidemic of mislaying bits of paper. Trif, here,
has been worrying all day about a letter to Phil
which she began but didn't finish. I told her it
was the easiest thing in the world to write a
letter to one's own husband&mdash;or ought to be, but
she has upset her entire room while searching
for that wretched note."</p>

<p>Trif tried to laugh, but she felt very uncomfortable.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>

To change the subject of conversation
she called Trixy and examined the child's shoes
to see that they were tied, and she set Trixy's
hat properly upon her head. Meanwhile Kate
continued to talk about the Admiral and the
Lieutenant, and their lost sketches and memoranda,
and Trixy took part in the conversation
by saying that the Admiral was nicer than ever,
because he wrote a long letter for her, the day
before, to send to her dear papa.</p>

<p>"Trixy!" exclaimed Fenie. "How could you
trouble some one not of the family to write a
letter for you?"</p>

<p>"Why, him and me is good friends, and
mamma began a letter for me, but she put off
finishing it, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Trif arose with a start, took the child's hand,
and walked away so rapidly that a family woman
sitting near by remarked to another family
woman that it looked very much as if a certain
child was being led to punishment.</p>

<p>"Trixy, dear," asked Trif, as soon as she was
well away from the throng, "how did the Admiral
come to write that letter for you?"</p>

<p>"Why," explained Trixy, "I wanted that
letter finished, you know, 'cause I promised papa
when we started down here that I wouldn't
neglect him, so I tried to finish it myself, but
'twas dreadful hard work for me, 'cause the
bottom of a chair isn't a very good table, so I
asked the Admiral to finish it for me."</p>

<p>"But the letter itself&mdash;where did you get it?
Where is it now?"</p>

<p>"Got it out of your portfolio, where you put it
when you stopped writin' it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"You dreadful child! The letter I began for
you I sent to your father, just as it was, and the
one you took from my portfolio was my own."</p>

<p>Trixy had often been called dreadful; the word
was in common use in the family, although it was
generally accompanied by a smile and a kiss.
Now, however, there was no such demonstration.
Trif looked so stern that Trixy began to cry,
and, as the mother's expression did not relax, the
child was soon crying industriously, while Fenie,
who had been looking on from a distance wondering
what was going on, and indignant that
any one&mdash;except, perhaps, herself&mdash;should do
anything to make the dear child uncomfortable,
hurried to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I think you're making a great fuss about a
very small matter," said Fenie, with the firm conviction
and superior sense peculiar to very young
women. "I don't see anything to it that you can
complain of, except that Trixy got the wrong
letter finished. I'm sure you can have written
nothing which was unfit for your husband to receive."</p>

<p>"But suppose the Admiral has chanced to read
what was already written?"</p>

<p>"Suppose he did? What then?"</p>

<p>"He knows Jermyn, and&mdash;oh, oh, oh!"</p>

<p>Trif's manner was so tragical that Fenie was
mystified! What could it all mean? It couldn't
be that her sister had become too fond of Jermyn,
and had any foolishness to confess to her
husband; but, if not, what was there dreadful
about the fact that the Admiral knew Jermyn?</p>

<p>In the meantime, Trixy had followed the custom

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>

of children in general in such cases, which
is to get away from the scene of trouble as soon
as possible. Chancing to meet the Admiral himself,
she abruptly said to him:</p>

<p>"Say, mamma knows all about that letter. I
didn't tell her nothin'&mdash;she just guessed it."</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed the old man. Then he
looked as thoughtful and anxious for a moment
as if he were taking a fleet into action, and he
said, half to himself, "I must take the night-boat
for Washington. I hope Blogsham may
still be there. I must beg you to excuse me,
Trixy."</p>

<p>The Admiral hurried into the hotel, Trixy following
him as far as she could. At the other
front of the house she met Jermyn, followed by
a servant with a portmanteau.</p>

<p>"Good bye, little girl," said the officer. "I
shall be back in a couple of days. A friend of
mine is about to run up to Washington with one
of the government boats, and I'm going with
him. Please remember me to your mother and
aunt, and to Miss Trewman."</p>

<p>"What! you goin' to Washin'ton too. So's
the Admiral."</p>

<p>Jermyn stared wonderingly, and the last of him
that Trixy saw to remember was a face which
seemed one great frown.</p>

<span class="small">OFF THE SCENT.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Admiral and the Lieutenant met face to
face in the Army and Navy Club at Washington,
and each looked as if he were a rogue
about to tumble into the clutches of the law.
After a moment of mute inquiry of each other's
faces the Admiral asked:</p>

<p>"Jermyn, how on earth did you reach here?
I thought I left you at Fort Monroe?"</p>

<p>"And I," said Jermyn, "supposed I had left
you at Old Point, when I suddenly ran up here
on a matter of personal business."</p>

<p>"Ah! Trying to be transferred to some other
branch of the service, where there's more chance
of promotion? Well, I can't blame you. In
time of peace a man must wait a long while for
his just deserts, and in time of war he may be
killed before they can reach him. 'Tis a queer
world."</p>

<p>"It certainly is, or some things in it are very
queer."</p>

<p>"Excuse a plain question, please. That letter
upon which you and I sketched a day or two
ago at the club&mdash;was it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, Jermyn, is that letter on your
mind too? My dear boy, my sole purpose in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

hurrying off to Washington last night was to
recover that letter. I can't imagine where it is
unless our enterprising friend Blogsham took it
with him."</p>

<p>"You knew its contents?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;unfortunately for my peace of mind
since I was asked to read it. But you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I," said Jermyn, "glanced at it, supposing
it to be memoranda about the property you were
discussing; I had no idea that it could be a private
letter. You will understand why I would
like to know something further about it, principally
to save one woman, possibly two women,
from great mortification should the letter itself
fall into the wrong hands."</p>

<p>"Possibly two women?" repeated the Admiral.
"Do you mean to say that you don't
know who the writer was?"</p>

<p>"I've not the slightest idea."</p>

<p>The Admiral knocked the ashes from his cigar,
and took several puffs, regarding Jermyn quizzically
in the meantime, before he replied:</p>

<p>"Dear boy, you've a powerful friend at court,
if your interests are what they might be. The
writer of the letter, who I assure you is not a
member of my own family, was writing to some
one to whom she has an entire right to open
her mind freely. If that little scamp Trixy
hadn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha! Mrs. Highwood was the writer, eh?"</p>

<p>Jermyn seemed greatly relieved by his discovery,
but the Admiral said indignantly:</p>

<p>"Jermyn, you ought to be ashamed of yourself
for entrapping an old friend in that way&mdash;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>

you really ought. Beside, you ought to be
grateful that so good a woman is taking so great
interest in you. As to the lady whom she named,
any man alive ought to be glad of an opportunity
to make love to her, and marry her, but if you
don't think so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I fully agree with you, Admiral, but if the
lady herself chances to hear of it&mdash;if our mining
acquaintance chances to be one of the fellows
who sees a joke in everything, and doesn't care
to whom he tells it, and if he has the letter, and
shows it to mutual acquaintances&mdash;well, you
know how a story gains by being passed from
man to man."</p>

<p>"Quite true, quite true," assented the Admiral
with a groan. "We must look the fellow up,
and at once. Bless me! To think that all this
trouble came about through a child asking me
to finish a letter to her father. If I could lay
my hands upon that youngster at this moment
I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd probably romp with her as pleasantly
as if nothing had occurred."</p>

<p>"Yes, probably."</p>

<p>Trixy would have been glad of some one to
romp with at that moment, for she was very
unhappy. Her mother seemed utterly wretched;
at other times when Trif was troubled in mind,
Trixy had been quick to note it and to be very
affectionate, and had been so successful as to
be called her mamma's greatest comfort. Fenie,
too, was miserable, for Trif had told her what
was in the missing letter, and Fenie was sure
that if the letter itself fell into improper hands,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

and Kate should hear about it, and learn who
was the writer, there would be another danger
of coolness between the two families, for Kate
was too proud to endure any interference with
her own affairs. Fenie had her own reasons
for objecting to any such trouble, for she was
very happy with Harry; there had been no talk
of love, but none was necessary. Young people
have ways of understanding each other quite
independently of words; do not even deaf
mutes fall in love?</p>

<p>Now, however, even Fenie's pleasant chats
with Harry might have to be suspended, for
Trif was in such abject fear and mortification
that she would scarcely leave her room, and
Fenie did not like to appear entirely unattended
and unwatched by her sister. No one would
talk if she were seen with Kate and Harry
together, but Fenie herself, like Trif, had imagined
all sorts of possible and impossible ways
by which that dreadful letter, or some garbled
report of it, might reach Kate.</p>

<p>So, the sisters sat in their room, and feared,
and felt like a couple of criminals to whom the
worst might happen. They exchanged forebodings,
all of which were overheard by Trixy,
who received a reproachful look with each, and
did quite a lot of silent weeping on her own
account, and neither her mother nor her aunt
dried her eyes with kisses, as they usually did at
home after she had done something wrong, and
repented.</p>

<p>But the kind power that looks after children
and fools came finally to Trixy's relief, for Trif
suddenly said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely the mail is distributed by this time,
and I can have at least the consolation of a
letter from dear Phil. Trixy, go down to the
office and ask for letters for our room."</p>

<p>Trixy flew away like a bird from an opened
cage, and no sooner did she reach the lower
floor than she dashed through one of the exits
to the beach. How delicious the sunlight was,
after part of a morning in a half-darkened room!&mdash;the
child felt as if she were bathing in it.
And the beach, too, with its long edging of
smooth, hard sand,&mdash;she must have just one run
on it, from pier to pier, and back again.</p>

<p>It was a merry run, but it put her out of
breath, so she threw herself down upon the sand
to rest for a moment, and the warm-hearted sand
welcomed her so pleasantly that she waited a
moment longer, and then another, and soon she
began to doze, for contemplation of other people's
troubles had wearied her early in the day.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was roused by the touch of a
parasol-tip. Looking up, she saw Kate Trewman,
who said:</p>

<p>"Trixy, is your family ill, or merely sleepy?
They usually are down early to breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're bothered. My what a fuss!
Say, you won't get angry at 'em, will you?"</p>

<p>"Not I! Why should I? I shall be very
sorry, though, if they remain in their rooms all
morning, for I miss them greatly. I don't find
any of my acquaintances this morning."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Well, I know where one of
'em is. He's gone to Washin'ton, Lieutenant
Jermyn has."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate said nothing in reply, but Trixy exclaimed,
"Goodness gracious! How bad you
do feel about it! So do I. But he's comin'
back&mdash;comin' to-morrow, 'cause he said he'd be
gone only a couple of days. Oh, how quick you
do get glad again!"</p>

<p>Kate abruptly turned her face aside, hid it in
her parasol, and thanked herself that she had
no little sister or niece, to be always observing
her&mdash;and so exasperatingly correctly, too! At
that moment her brother joined her, and asked
Trixy if she would give his card, on which he
had pencilled a line or two, to her Aunt Fee.
This reminded Trixy that she had been sent for
the mail, so she danced off in the direction of
the office, while Harry and Kate walked to and
fro, and talked of everything but what was
uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>Trixy found additional causes of detention.
The mail was late, and a throng of people were
at the desk awaiting the distribution, so Trixy
went to the front door to look at the flowers
which colored people brought every morning to
sell to the guests. Then she strolled toward the
fort, to look at an old colored beggar, whose
raggedness was so picturesque that it fascinated
her. As she stood staring at him, a servant
from the fort accosted her with,</p>

<p>"Little girl, you know Adm'ral All'son, don't
you?&mdash;the old gen'leman that bosses all you
young ones when you digs sand-wells?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do; he's one of my best friends."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got lots to do this mornin', an' I
don't see how I'm goin' to git through. Don't
you want to give this letter to him for me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"You won't forgit it, will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I'm not of the forgettin' kind."
And Trixy took the letter, forgetting for the
moment that the Admiral had gone to Washington.
Then she hurried back to the hotel, got
the mail, and went into her mother's room,
saying:</p>

<p>"Let me open the letters for you, won't you,
like papa does?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but do it quickly," said Trif, first selecting
one from her husband, which she quickly
read and re-read. Then she took the others,
after Trixy had cut the ends of the envelopes,
and glanced over them, commenting as she
read:</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;nothing unusual. Mrs. Poynce's
cards, the Misses Brimling's tea, on Thursday
next&mdash;I shall be sorry to miss it; invitation to
a spring opening, and&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>Trif fell back in her chair, as if in a faint.
Fenie hurried to her, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Trif, dear! What is the matter? Speak to
me, quick!"</p>

<p>"That letter! That awful letter that I began
for Trixy! Here it is!"</p>

<p>"Dear me! Where could it have come
from?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine. Why&mdash;the envelope is
addressed to Admiral Allison! How could it
have got among our letters?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Trixy, as excited as anyone, "a
man gave me the letter, a few minutes ago, to
give to the Admiral, and I forgot all about it,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

and I've gone and cut the end of it, with the
others!"</p>

<p>"But who can it have come from?" persisted
Trif, looking into the envelope. "There is
nothing else with it, and some one had drawn
pictures on blank parts of the sheets."</p>

<p>"He must have lent it to someone, who is
returning it to him," suggested Fenie.</p>

<p>"I've always supposed naval officers the soul
of honor?" sighed Trif.</p>

<p>"Won't you give me the drawing on the back
of it for my scrap-book, mamma?" asked Trixy.
No objection being made, Trixy tore the Admiral's
sketch of the gold placer and vicinity
from the sheet, and pasted it into a fearfully
and wonderfully made book of pictures, which
she had brought from home. She looked at
Jermyn's sketch a moment, thought it very like
the other, and cast it aside. Her mother picked
it up, read the page which she had written, and
then she and Fenie devised wildly improbable
theories of the history of the letter. The conclusion
finally reached, greatly though they
regretted it, was that the letter had been lent
by the Admiral to someone in the fort, with the
impression that there was some fun in it. If
army and navy officers saw jokes in such things,
of course Jermyn would soon hear of the letter
itself, to his great discomfort; for the sisters
agreed that he was too much of a gentleman to
laugh over such a matter. Suddenly Fenie
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's something more dreadful still. You'll
have to return the letter to the Admiral."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never," Trif replied. "I shall mail it to
Phil this very afternoon." Suiting the action to
the word she enclosed it in an envelope, addressed
it, and affixed a stamp to it.</p>

<p>"But," remonstrated Fenie, "when the Admiral
returns he will want to know where the letter
is, and he will speak to the man to whom he
lent it, and the man will say that he sent it back,
and the servant will be questioned and say he
gave it to Trixy, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Probably the messenger doesn't know Trixy
by sight or name," said Trif.</p>

<p>"Oh, he knows me well enough," said Trixy.
"He's servant to somebody in the fort, and the
somebody's little girls play with me on the
beach sometimes, and he comes for 'em at
dinnertime and lunch time."</p>

<p>"I see nothing to be done, then," said Trif,
"but for me to return to New York at once.
We certainly owe neither courtesy nor explanation
to the Admiral, whom we won't have the
embarrassment of meeting if we are not here.
Why, Fenie, you're crying. What is the matter,
dear?"</p>

<p>"I should think you might know, without
asking," sobbed the girl, "you, who have been
in love, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You poor, dear child. Your sister is a
thoughtless, heartless brute. Still, the Trewmans
themselves will not remain here long;
Kate said they had dropped over here only
for a day or two, to see what the place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that reminds me," said Trixy. "Harry
gave me a card for Aunt Fee a few minutes
ago. Here it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Fenie read the message on the card, and
looked pleased, although she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry thinks they too will have to go to
New York, this very evening. He&mdash;that is,
Kate, is waiting for me down stairs. You won't
mind my joining her, will you? She does so
dislike to be kept waiting."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<span class="small">THE SEARCH PARTY.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Admiral and the Lieutenant searched
Washington quickly yet thoroughly, for the
man who was supposed to have the fateful letter
in his possession was prominent enough to have
his every movement observed and recorded by
the newspapers and discussed by the clubs. No
one at Washington had seen him or heard of
him since his departure for Old Point.</p>

<p>"Let us hope, dear boy," said the Admiral, as
the disappointed and weary men lunched together,
"that he has gone to the Pacific Coast to
develop that placer, for no one out there will
take any interest in that unfortunate note."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to hope so," Jermyn replied,
"but suppose that he has gone to New
York? That is his usual base of operations,
and should he have the letter, and meet in New
York some one who knows me, it would be just
like him to show the letter and talk about it."</p>

<p>"I shall at once go to New York, find him, if
he is there, and stop him," said the Admiral.</p>

<p>"But, Admiral&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But me no buts, my dear boy. I assure you
that if it weren't for my humiliation at having
been a thoughtless old donkey I'd enjoy the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

job almost as well as if I were in active service
and in chase of an enemy. A chase will do me
good&mdash;keep me from rusting, you know."</p>

<p>"But, Admiral, you were having a delightful
time at the Point; there was a host of your
friends and old comrades there, and they will
soon be going away. I've three days' leave of
absence, and no farther use to make of it here.
Still more, I'm the party most at interest, you
know."</p>

<p>"But I'm the one most at fault," persisted the
Admiral. It was finally agreed that there should
be a division of labor, the Admiral returning to
Old Point, where he might learn from some one
the destination of the supposed custodian of the
letter, while Jermyn should hurry to New York,
where it would not be very hard to find the
wanted man if he were there.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant had not been long in the
metropolis before he learned that even a man
known throughout the nation could not easily be
found in a city as large as New York. He first
went to a club where some old acquaintances
were so glad to see him that he had hard work
in getting away from them. They all knew by
name and reputation the man he was looking for
and congratulated Jermyn on having any excuse
for seeing a man who had made the fortunes of
a dozen other men while making his own, but
of the man's whereabouts they were as ignorant
as Jermyn himself. Then Jermyn made the
rounds of the principal hotels, but he found that
their number had trebled since his own period of
duty near New York, ten years earlier, and he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>

began to think seriously of applying for an additional
leave of absence for three days, on the
ground of urgent and unexpected personal
business.</p>

<p>He was so weary at the end of a single day's
search, that he had not the heart to go to club
or theatre, so he dined dismally and alone at
Delmonico's, and then sauntered over to Madison
Square, dropped upon a bench, and blamed the
trees for not being as fully in leaf as those he
had left in the South, three hundred miles away.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gentleman arose from a bench
near by, walked to and fro two or three times,
stopped in front of the lonely officer, and said:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but aren't you Lieutenant
Jermyn, of the artillery service?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Highwood!" exclaimed Jermyn, springing
to his feet, and extending his hand, "this is
rare good fortune for me."</p>

<p>"And for me," replied Phil; "for you are the
only person I know who has seen my family
within a week, and I'm as lonesome without
that family as you can ever have been at the
smallest post you ever served at. Take pity on
a poor fellow, and tell me all you can."</p>

<p>"Your loss is their gain," said Jermyn, when
both had seated themselves. "I never saw
Mrs. Highwood looking better. As for your
daughter, she is one of the most engaging young
women I ever met, except her mother, whom she
greatly resembles. Miss Wardlow, whom Mrs.
Highwood told me was in poor health when
she left New York, is simply radiant; she is the
beauty of the Point, although she doesn't seem

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>

to know it. They all talk of you a great deal;
to hear Miss Trixy is to believe you the only
man on the face of the earth."</p>

<p>"Bless her!" said Phil. "By the way, there
are some neighbors of ours there, I believe&mdash;the
Trewmans. Have you chanced to meet them?"</p>

<p>As he asked this question, Phil looked sidewise
at his companion, and was sure, despite
the uncertain light of an electric lamp, that the
officer's face colored a little. But Jermyn replied,
in his ordinary tone:</p>

<p>"Delightful people&mdash;delightful! By the way,
I've a suspicion that you're in danger of losing
your sister-in-law; at least as a member of
your immediate family. Mr. Trewman is devotion
itself, and although the young lady has
many admirers, Mr. Trewman seems to be the
favored one."</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, I don't know that either of them
could do better. They are already very well
acquainted, and Fenie is quite fond of Harry's
sister, whom I imagine does not disapprove of
the match."</p>

<p>Jermyn did not reply, so Highwood continued
to talk about the Trewmans, and particularly
about Kate; and Jermyn replied briefly, from
time to time, speaking of Kate so admiringly,
yet guardedly, that Phil began to wonder
whether the officer had not been making love
with traditional military haste, and had his suit
discouraged. Being too good a man to persist
in talking of a subject regarding which his
companion felt any reason for restraint, he
hastened to change the subject, and the two men

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>

were soon engaged in general chat. Phil soon
asked:</p>

<p>"How long shall you remain in the city, Mr.
Jermyn? Or perhaps you are to be on duty
here?"</p>

<p>"Only on personal business, which may take
three or four days."</p>

<p>"Good! I'll try to see that your spare time
passes pleasantly. Several new military pictures
are to be exhibited at my club, and I'll be glad
to have you see them, if you find the time. I
received several invitations in blank to-day; let
me give you one."</p>

<p>Phil drew some papers from his pocket, and
began to search for the invitations, holding his
letters and other papers so that the light might
strike them fairly. Suddenly he was conscious
of a start. He looked up inquiringly, and saw
Jermyn gazing intently at a letter which Phil
held in his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Phil, quickly, "apparently you
recognize this picture. Perhaps you can tell me
what it is. It has puzzled me not a little, for it
is on the back of a letter from my wife, who
sketches a little, but this sketch is not in her
style."</p>

<p>"It reminds me," replied Jermyn deliberately,
and with a visible affectation of carelessness,
"of a bit of far Western scenery, which I used
to know quite well, having been there on duty."</p>

<p>Jermyn wished he could be alone a moment&mdash;wished
he were a boy again, and in the centre
of a great field or forest, where he could give a
great, joyous shout. That missing letter! It

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>

had reached rightful hands at last&mdash;but how?
He must telegraph the Admiral at once; how
delighted the dear old fellow would be! Still,
how in the name of all that was mysterious, had
the tormenting screed found its way to the man
to whom it was written? There was no address,
nor even name, on the paper when he glanced
at it in the fort, so the man for whom the
sketches were made could not have known to
whom it belonged.</p>

<p>"When did you receive the sketch, Mr. Highwood?"
Jermyn asked. "Perhaps there is an
artist at the Point, of whom I have not heard."</p>

<p>"It came this morning," Phil replied, hoping
at the same time that his face was not telling of
what was running in his mind. What would
the man beside him think if he could know the
contents of the letter? "It was evidently begun
on one day and finished on another, for there
are hints in it of a story which Mrs. Highwood
will tell me when she reaches home. She is a
dear, good wife, but she does hate to write a
longer letter than is absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>"I wonder that she gets time to write at all,"
said Jermyn, "for she is in great demand.
She has probably written you that she has met
several old acquaintances; nice people from
everywhere seem to gravitate toward Old Point."</p>

<p>Then Jermyn lapsed into such deep thought
about that letter, and the ways in which it might
have got back to its owner, that he almost forgot
that he was not alone.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter with the fellow?"
wondered Highwood. "If Trif were almost any

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>

other woman in the world, I would think that
there was some mystery in which she and he
were mutually interested. I shall write her before
I sleep, and ask her all about it; I don't
know when in my life I've been so curious about
anything."</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Highwood," said Jermyn,
with the idea that he might get some clue to the
course of the letter, "I ought to tell you that
your daughter is flirting most outrageously with
one of the finest gentlemen at the Point. He is
a retired admiral&mdash;Allison&mdash;perhaps you may
have heard his name?"</p>

<p>"Heard of him?" echoed Phil; "all Americans
are proud of him. That isn't all; he acted
as Trixy's amanuensis a day or two ago, and I
suspect that some of the funny things in the letter
which I received were devised by him; I've
played that trick myself with Trixy's missives at
times."</p>

<p>"Possibly you are right," was the reply, "for
he is as full of fun as any one I know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the Admiral was the artist who drew
that sketch?" Phil suggested.</p>

<p>"H'm! No, I think not. I know his style."</p>

<p>"Would you mind asking him on your return?"
persisted Phil.</p>

<p>"Not in the least. I probably shall see him
to-morrow night, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! Is he, too, coming to New York?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He had intended to come, but I
came instead."</p>

<p>"But how can you see him to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"Easily. I shall take the morning train, which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>

will get me to the fort by nine o'clock, at the
latest."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but didn't I understand you to
say that you would be here several days?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;I had intended to remain several days,
but I've had the bad manners to think occasionally
about business while we've been talking, and
something has come to mind which will compel
my return at once. 'Tis a mean thing to admit,
but greatly though I've enjoyed meeting you
here&mdash;and I assure you that I never in my life
met any one more gladly&mdash;my personal business,
which brought me here, has persisted in popping
into my head. I left the fort in great haste&mdash;so
great that I left some of the threads of my
business behind me."</p>

<p>Phil Highwood was a gentleman, so he detested
any one who pried into the private affairs
of others, but for a moment he wished himself a
mind-reader, or hypnotist, or something of the
sort. Meanwhile, Jermyn, who felt that he must
be alone, said:</p>

<p>"Won't you honor me with some message to
your family?"</p>

<p>"Tell my wife to write me who drew that
sketch, please?"</p>

<p>The two men separated, and Jermyn hurried
up Broadway, feeling younger than he had at
any time in the last ten years.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<span class="small">A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING his trip from Washington back to
Old Point, the Admiral promised himself
several times that he never again would endeavor
to complete a letter begun by any other person.
He also resolved that, on reaching the hotel, he
would make a full and frank explanation to Mrs.
Highwood, and would offer to make reparation,
so far as was in his power, by acting as an ally
in the lady's campaign to effect the capture of
Kate and Jermyn by each other. He had done
some discreet match-making in his time, so he
felt justified in assuring Trif that there were ways
in which he might be useful.</p>

<p>The matter was arranged to his entire satisfaction,
in his own mind, before he fell asleep,
but somehow plans made at night, even by persons
of much experience and shrewdness, do not
always stand the test of daylight. He had been
at the hotel two or three hours when he came
face to face with Trif; the lady passed him with
half-averted face and the slightest possible inclination
of the head. The Admiral felt indignant,
and not a little angry. Could it be possible that
matters had gone from bad to worse during his
absence? There was no pluckier man in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>

service than Rear-Admiral Allison, retired, but
for a moment or two the old gentleman was
tempted to leave Old Point at once.</p>

<p>Soon, however, he regained his courage and
did some cautious reconnoitering. He made the
tour of the office, parlors, piazzas, and beach, and
his search was finally rewarded by a glimpse of
Kate and her brother, strolling to and fro on the
pier. Had any harm, any publicity, come of
that enraging letter, Kate would probably be
more angry than any one else, and the first person
to whom he should explain, so with a sinking
feeling, such as he had not experienced
since the time he first went into action, he strode
down the pier. Miss Trewman was not above
the average height of women, but she looked
very tall and imperious as the Admiral marched
forward to his fate, whatever it might be. Suddenly
Kate saw him and seemed surprised; then
she stepped quickly toward him. The old gentleman
felt himself turning pale, but Kate gave
him a smile which made him as happy, he afterward
told her, as if he were again a young man,
and she his sweetheart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Admiral!" exclaimed Kate, "how glad
I am to see you back! Everything here has
been stupid since you went away. Has anything
gone wrong with&mdash;with any one?"</p>

<p>"Not with you, I'm sure, if looks are any indication.
How is Mrs. Highwood and her sister,
and Trixy?"</p>

<p>"Trif appears to be ill, although she says
nothing is the matter with her. Fenie is worrying
about Trif, and poor little Trixy seems in
trouble about something."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'm," said the Admiral, looking grave.</p>

<p>"Something is the matter," exclaimed Kate.
"I see it in your face. Do tell me what it is.
The Highwoods are old friends of ours, and if I
could know of anything that should be done for
any of them I would be very grateful."</p>

<p>"Really, I know of nothing. Lieutenant
Jermyn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kate's face colored, and the Admiral's keen
eyes twinkled as their owner continued:</p>

<p>"Jermyn and I ran up to Washington a night
or two ago on business, so I've heard of nothing
that has occurred here since then. Jermyn
wasn't able to return with me, but he won't
remain long away; indeed, I know he has the
best of reasons for wishing himself back again."</p>

<p>Again Kate blushed, which was exactly what
the Admiral hoped would be the result of his
speech. Still, the girl seemed suspicious about
something, so the old gentleman began to talk
of something else with his customary ability.
While he was talking, a waiter from the hotel
approached and handed him a telegram.</p>

<p>"Kindly excuse me a moment?" said the
Admiral, adjusting his glasses and opening the
envelope. Then he glanced at the dispatch and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"May we congratulate you upon something?&mdash;the
thanks of Congress, or a new war?"</p>

<p>"Better still. The business upon which Jermyn
and I went North has been satisfactorily
concluded. Will you kindly excuse me a few
moments, until I can write a letter? I will do
myself the honor of rejoining you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is probably some secret government
business in the hands of the Admiral and the
Lieutenant," suggested Harry.</p>

<p>"Secret nonsense! It is something which
is mixed up in some way with the strange
manner of Trif and Fenie, and the Admiral
must simply tell what it is."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old gentleman was re-reading
the dispatch, which was as follows:</p>

<p>"That letter is in proper hands. Jermyn."</p>

<p>"Proper hands! Proper hands!" repeated
the Admiral to himself. "Evidently that means
his own hands. Fine fellow! He deserves the
girl, if only for the pains he has taken to keep
her name from being used publicly. How I wish
I might tell her the whole story! Still, if they
continue to like each other, my time will come.
I think that I ought now to be able to make
my peace with Mrs. Highwood. I need merely
to repeat to her Jermyn's own words, and crave
the privilege of age to laugh with her over a
matter entirely to her credit."</p>

<p>Within five minutes the Admiral had dispatched
a note to Trif, who languidly opened
it and then suddenly dropped her languor and
called Fenie, to whom she said:</p>

<p>"What can the man mean? There can be
but one letter that the man refers to&mdash;the one
which Trixy gave him, and which she got back
so strangely, and I sent on to Phil, promising
that I would tell him something about it when
I reached home. Phil don't know the Admiral,
so I can't make sense out of the matter. It
isn't possible that Trixy is making any more
trouble with letters?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" replied Fenie. "What did
the poor child know about the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm afraid she overheard us wondering
whether the letter ought not go back to the Admiral,
because whoever sent it back to him
would be sure to ask whether he received it, and&mdash;Trixy,
where are you? Have you opened any
of my letters?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma; really and truly I haven't,"
was the indignant reply.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Trif, "I do wish I could find out
what it means. If I don't know pretty soon I'm
sure I shall go insane."</p>

<p>Fenie made haste to be sisterly and soothing,
and Trixy improved the opportunity to escape
from the room. She hurried down to the piazza,
asked every one she knew whether they had
seen the Admiral, and finally she found him talking
with Kate and Harry. She did not wait for
a lull in the conversation; she stopped before
him and interrupted with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say, you don't want my dear mamma to go
insane, do you?"</p>

<p>"Bless me, no! What do you mean, child?"</p>

<p>"Why, she says she's goin' to go insane if she
doesn't find out all about that letter."</p>

<p>The Admiral looked embarrassed; then he
said: "You will kindly excuse me a few moments,
Miss Trewman," and quickly led Trixy
aside, while Kate told her brother that she, too,
would go insane, she thought, unless she could
know what dreadful mystery was in the air.</p>

<p>The Admiral made haste to send the child to
her mother with the request that Mrs. Highwood

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>

would kindly grant an interview in one of
the less frequented parlors, which he designated.
Within a few moments he was talking earnestly
with Trif and trying to convince her that the
troublesome letter was in Jermyn's possession.</p>

<p>Then he lost his mental balance for a moment
or two, for Trif assured him that beyond doubt
he was mistaken, for she had mailed the letter
to her husband, who by no possibility could have
given it to any one.</p>

<p>The Admiral made haste to put Jermyn's dispatch
in evidence, and again Trif was mystified,
for although she knew that her husband
and Jermyn were acquainted it seemed scarcely
possible that Jermyn had called on Phil while
on the errand which the old gentleman had carefully
explained, with the effect of making her
appear his admirer once more. The Admiral
tried to reason it out, and offered the suggestion
that perhaps her husband had done, in a blunt,
straightforward way, as most honest men are
likely to do, exactly what she would have wished
him to do.</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it, my dear madam,
that what I have suggested is exactly what has
happened. They have met, probably by accident;
your husband has quizzed Jermyn about
Miss Trewman, Jermyn has admitted his interest
in the lady; your husband has expressed
his interest and volunteered his assistance, and
to show that you also were interested he has
given Jermyn&mdash;not the letter, but some word
which has satisfied the young man that the letter
reached its proper destination."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you are right," said Trif, "and for
the rest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the rest," continued the Admiral, "can't
you and I afford to laugh the matter away?
I've honestly explained how innocently I was
led to read what Trixy brought me. The letter
itself did great credit to your head and heart;
the young people are singularly suited to each
other, and there is no probability that Miss
Trewman will ever hear anything about it, for
the manner in which the letter was returned to
you shows that it was forwarded to me by some
one who was present when I thoughtlessly
sketched upon it. As no one but army officers,
and one other person, was there, it is probable
that some officer returned it, and army officers
are gentlemen; none of them would repeat what
he chanced to see in a private letter, particularly
as his most natural conclusion would be that the
letter, having been seen in my possession, had
been written to me by some member of my own
family."</p>

<p>Trif felt much better, and finally pleased the
old gentleman by laughing and accepting him
as an ally, and also by accepting his invitation
to walk upon the beach and take some delicious
air, of which, through his own carelessness, she
had recently been deprived.</p>

<p>Trif was as happy as an innocent soul released
suddenly from prison, and the Admiral, his own
honest heart relieved of its burden, was chatting
cheerily and delightfully, when both met Trixy,
who looked as if something dreadful had befallen
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear little darling, what is the matter?"
asked Trif.</p>

<p>"She said she wondered if you'd been doin'
anythin' dreadful, 'cause I said you might get
insane."</p>

<p>"She? Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Trewman. And I just told her,
'no, indeed,' and she said it was too bad that a
letter should make anybody such a lot of trouble,
and I told her that the letter wasn't about you
at all, but was all about her, 'cause I heard you
and Aunt Fee talkin' about it. Then she looked
awful cross, and I told her she needn't, 'cause
'twas about somethin' nice for her."</p>

<p>"Trixy, dear, how much more did you tell
her?"</p>

<p>"Nothin', mamma. You don't think I'm
goin' to tell things to people, after all you've
said to me about not doin' it, do you? I only
told her that you and papa was arrangin' a real
nice s'prise for her, and she asked if the Admiral
was helpin' do it, 'cause he seemed to be.
But I didn't tell her nothin' about it&mdash;really I
didn't."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<span class="small">THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">JERMYN hurried back to his post of duty
with such mental rapidity that neither train
nor steamer could keep pace with him. He told
himself that he was a fool; that he had not
known Kate Trewman a week, and that in the
first half of that same week he had imagined
himself in love with Trif's sister, yet, after everything
that he could say against himself, the fact
remained that he was so interested in Miss Trewman
that he had all sorts of fears as to what
might happen to his prospects during his absence.</p>

<p>He told himself that probably she was already
engaged to some other man, for such women
were so scarce that he could not understand
how one of them had thus far escaped matrimony.
He also reminded himself that he had
been admiring fine women all his life, and that
quite a number of them had married other men,
generally before he had been able to interest
them in himself. Still, what did that prove?
Merely, that good men, like great men, thought
alike. He would not make a fool of himself; he
really wasn't in love, but he certainly would endeavor
to become better acquainted with Miss

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>

Trewman, and if she were not already promised
to another, he would make her his own, unless
she objected.</p>

<p>The first thing necessary, however, upon reaching
Old Point, was to report to his superior officer.
He, therefore, hurried to the fort; then, on
his way back to the hotel, he dropped into the
club, merely to see who was there, or had been
there, and in an instant he was buttonholed by
the Admiral, who drew him aside, and said:</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it! Facts first and explanations
afterward."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to tell," Jermyn replied,
"except that Mr. Highwood has that exasperating
letter. Is there anything new at the hotel?"</p>

<p>"Nothing except that Miss Trixy&mdash;what a
genius for mischief that child has!&mdash;Trixy has
made a coolness in some way between the Highwoods
and Trewmans. Miss Trewman acts all
the while as if there was something on her mind
that was worth being indignant about, and I
assure you that the entire situation is extremely
uncomfortable for a certain old gentleman who
wishes nothing but the best to all parties."</p>

<p>Jermyn frowned and said:</p>

<p>"I suppose the sooner I try to find out what it
all is about, the better it will be for my peace of
mind."</p>

<p>"Be very careful, I beg of you, my dear boy,"
exclaimed the Admiral, as Jermyn started away.
"Miss Trewman is a most estimable young woman,
but she has a mind of her own."</p>

<p>"So much the better. It probably will teach
her to have proper respect for other peoples'
minds."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"But mayn't I suggest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;when I return."</p>

<p>With that reply, the Admiral looked miserable
and undecided, and he finally persuaded some
one to join him at a game of checkers, which to
that day he had thought the last refuge of an
adult mind which also was diseased.</p>

<p>Jermyn hurried toward the hotel, determined
to take whatever misfortune might come to him,
rather than be annoyed by more accidents. As
to Trixy&mdash;Jermyn had always liked children, and
years before, he had made a reputation on a western
bound train, and afterward in the service, by
caring all night for a fretful child so that the infant's
mother might get some needed rest. He
wished he might have charge of Trixy for a few
days; she was Trif's child, and Trif was to him
the ideal woman, and it was impossible that the
child should not have inherited some of her
mother's estimable qualities; but if Trixy had
been making new and unexpected trouble for
him, he wished there might be excuse for putting
her into the most remote casemate of the fort,
locking the door, and losing the key.</p>

<p>As he thought and fretted, he entered the
hotel and made his way through office and parlor
toward the ball-room, where every one who
did not dance congregated to look at every one
who did. He nodded to several acquaintances,
but his thoughts were entirely about Trixy until
he was recalled to better command of himself by
the sound of a well-remembered voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Jermyn! What an unexpected pleasure!
We were told that you would be away
several days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to say that I am not so unfortunate,"
Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Jermyn," piped a small voice
from somewhere behind Miss Trewman, and
then the young man saw Trixy, looking as innocent
and confiding as if nothing whatever had
happened which could trouble her mind or her
conscience.</p>

<p>"Trixy!" exclaimed Jermyn, advancing menacingly
upon the child. "I met your father
yesterday, and he told me to give you a thorough
shaking for him"&mdash;here he picked up the
child and acted according to Phil's orders&mdash;"and,"
he continued, "I suppose he would have
sent you a kiss also if I hadn't left him in haste,
so I'll give you one on suspicion."</p>

<p>"That is a very interesting child," said Kate,
as Trixy hurried away to find her mother and
aunt and report Jermyn's return, "but I do think
she can make more trouble than any other child
I ever heard of."</p>

<p>"Such offences must be condoned, I suppose,"
replied Jermyn, too happily surprised by his reception
to harbor ill-will against any one.</p>

<p>"What a forgiving mood&mdash;for a soldier!"
said Kate, who imagined Jermyn knew something
of the mystery she was trying to fathom.</p>

<p>"Soldiers are often compelled to learn that
those who do most harm mean least," Jermyn
replied. "But what has the child been doing
since I went away?"</p>

<p>"I've not the slightest idea. Perhaps she has
done nothing, but she has excited my curiosity
greatly, through some references to myself."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>

Then Kate looked enquiringly into Jermyn's
eyes, and the young man was so delighted to be
looked at by her in any way that he met her
gaze unflinchingly, although respectfully, and
finally overcame it, and Kate, wishing to change
the subject of conversation, murmured something
about the heat of the room.</p>

<p>"Let us escape from it," suggested Jermyn,
"and join Mrs. Highwood and her sister. Probably
they are on the piazza, for I saw Trixy
disappear in that direction."</p>

<p>No one who hasn't tried it knows how hard it
is to find any one on a crowded piazza a quarter
of a mile long, and after sunset too. Success is
still more difficult when the searchers have something
else to concern their minds and eyes.
Jermyn and Kate were clever talkers, and neither
of them had often found company so agreeable,
so they passed and repassed Trif and Fenie
several times without seeing them, and Trif
smiled archly, and Fenie gave her a warning
pinch, for Harry was with them.</p>

<p>Harry himself was no fool, and as the ladies
themselves suddenly lapsed into comparative
silence he remembered that his sister frequently
reminded him that ladies had affairs of their own
to talk about, so he insisted upon getting lemonade
for them, and the journey from the piazza to
the cafe was quite long, so there was much time
for chat before his return, and every moment of it
was improved, while Trixy, seated on a low stool,
with her head in her mother's lap, seemed slumbering
as peacefully as if in her bed, and the
physician at the hotel had assured Trif that the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>

salt air at night was not in the least unwholesome,
but quite the reverse.</p>

<p>When Harry returned, followed by a waiter
with a tray, and it was learned that he had not
forgotten the smallest member of the party,
Trixy awoke opportunely, and felt so refreshed
that she had to relieve herself of superabundant
vitality by tripping to and fro on the broad walk
at the edge of the beach, with several children
with whom she had become acquainted. They
were having a glorious time when Trixy suddenly
espied Kate and Jermyn; then she lost
interest in her companions and began to stare.</p>

<p>The objects of her attention did not notice
her; they would not have been conscious of the
presence of the President of the United States,
had that distinguished person passed them in
the full glare of the occasional lamps. They
were not talking love, nor anything remotely resembling
it, but they were entirely absorbed in
each other, which answered the same purpose.
Jermyn had promised a brother subaltern, only
two or three days before, some coaching in the
mysteries of ballistics, and for this very evening,
but he forgot all about it, and the subaltern, who
looked anxiously about for Jermyn and finally
found him, saw for himself that his chances
were very slight, so he sat down at the edge of
the promenade and engaged Trixy in conversation.
The child soon remarked:</p>

<p>"You don't think they're a couple of fools, do
you?"</p>

<p>"They? Who?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Why, Lieutenant Jermyn and Miss Trewman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not! What an odd question! If
you were a few years older, young lady, you
yourself would think them eminently sensible."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that true? Well, I'm glad of it, 'cause
a while ago Aunt Fee said if they wasn't fools
they'd make a match of it. How do people
make matches, anyhow? What do they make
'em of?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, young woman," replied the
youth, after a quiet laugh, "you're of a very inquiring
turn of mind. Perhaps you had better
put that question to your mother&mdash;no, not now."</p>

<p>"But they know, don't they? 'Cause if they
don't, how are they to make one?"</p>

<p>"That's for themselves to find out," answered
the young man, recalling an experience or two of
his own which had not been successful. "By
the way, how many wells have you dug to-day?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember," said Trixy, going into a
brown study. The young officer strolled off to
struggle by himself with his problem, leaving
Trixy with her own. A possible aid to solution
came to the child's mind. Exclaiming to herself,
"Why, of course!" she began to walk,
looking carefully at every person she met. Soon
she saw Jermyn and Kate and attached herself
to them.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" asked Kate in a tone so
tender that any hesitation the child may have
had vanished at once.</p>

<p>"Have you made it?"</p>

<p>"Made what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you don't know, it don't mind, I
s'pose. Lieutenant Prewser thought you did
know, or I wouldn't have asked you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"What on earth is the child talking about?"
asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, Trixy," said Jermyn.
"What did Prewser say we knew how to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, come to think of it, he didn't say you
knew, but he said it was for you to find out."</p>

<p>"But what was it?" persisted Kate.</p>

<p>"Why, 'twas how to make a match."</p>

<p>Kate suddenly averted her head, and acted as
if she wanted to run away. Jermyn took her
hand&mdash;gently, very gently, yet with sufficient
force to detain her. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Trixy, your mother wants you, this very instant."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<span class="small">THE UNEXPECTED.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">WHAT Jermyn and Kate said to each other
in the two or three minutes immediately
following Trixy's departure was entirely their
own affair, and need not be repeated here;
beside, they never afterward agreed exactly as
to what it was. Suffice it to say that they
walked somewhat rapidly in the direction of
the disappearing child, and parted pleasantly.
Kate joined her brother and Trif, and asked
how they had secreted themselves so successfully,
when she and Jermyn had been seeking
them everywhere for the last half-hour. She
asked also if the night was not simply
superb&mdash;heavenly! and whether they weren't
the stupidest people in the world to sit there
quietly while the air was simply entrancing.
For herself, she thought it an absolute sin to sit
still in such weather, so she begged Trixy to
take a little walk with her.</p>

<p>The child was quite willing, so the couple
strolled a few moments. Soon Trixy asked:</p>

<p>"Does lovely nights always make you so
dreadful quiet?"</p>

<p>"Am I quiet? I was thinking about something.
There! I shall stop thinking about it.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

But, Trixy dear, how did you and Lieutenant
Prewser come to talk about&mdash;about such things?"</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember what you said to
Lieutenant Jermyn and me?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o&mdash;o," drawled Trixy, whose mind had
roamed over several other subjects in the past
quarter hour. "What was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind it," said Kate hastily, "if
you don't recall it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it was about match-makin', wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Kate answered, so savagely that the
child started. "Did you ask your mother about
it?"</p>

<p>"No. I was goin' to, but they all was talkin'
about somethin' else, so I didn't get a chance."</p>

<p>"Then don't. There are some things about
which little girls shouldn't talk, and about which
their mammas don't like them to talk, and this
is one of them; so don't mention it to your
mother at all. Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," replied Trixy, with a drawl which
indicated doubt. "But mamma says, whenever
I want to know anythin' about anythin' I must
come and ask her right away."</p>

<p>"Very well, let me ask her for you, about
this, won't you? You know that I love you
very dearly, and wouldn't like your mamma to
think badly of you in any way, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then if you love me so much," interrupted
Trixy, "why don't you give me all the dolls you
said you would?"</p>

<p>"How shamefully forgetful I am! My dear

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

child, you shall have those dolls to-morrow, if I
have to go all the way to Norfolk for them."</p>

<p>"Good! good! good!"</p>

<p>"But," continued Kate, with an uplifted finger,
which looked very impressive in the semi-darkness,
"not&mdash;one&mdash;single&mdash;doll, if you say a word
about this matter to your mother."</p>

<p>"All right!"</p>

<p>"You are sure you will not forget?"</p>

<p>"Ever so sure. If I find myself thinkin'
about it at all I'll just say 'Dolls, dolls, dolls'
to myself as hard as I can, and then all the think
will go out of my mind."</p>

<p>"That's a good girl."</p>

<p>Then Kate lifted Trixy, embraced her, kissed
her, and called her the dearest little girl on the
face of the earth, after which, greatly to the
child's astonishment, she hurried Trixy to her
mother and excused herself, saying that she had
suddenly found the night air much damper than
she had supposed.</p>

<p>No sooner did Jermyn leave Kate's side than
he went to the ball-room, the office, and about
the piazzas, asking every acquaintance whether
Prewser had been seen in the course of the
evening. Finally he found his comrade and a
reproachful face in Prewser's own quarters, and
after some sharp questioning he promised to
help the young man at ballistics and anything
else so long as he lived. Prewser asked if congratulations
were in order, and Jermyn frowned
and said "Nonsense," but he afterwards whistled
merrily and Prewser began to nurse some suspicions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trixy, dear," said Fenie the next morning,
while preparing for breakfast, "if I were you I
wouldn't follow a lady and gentleman while
they are promenading in the evening. It isn't
ladylike. I am sure that your mamma will tell
you that I am right."</p>

<p>Trif looked amusedly at her sister and said,
"One word for others and two for yourself," but
she added her own cautions to Fenie's, and said
she ought to have called Trixy away from Kate
and Jermyn the evening before.</p>

<p>"Why, I only&mdash;" began Trixy. Then she
stopped and exclaimed "Dolls."</p>

<p>"What have dolls to do with it?" asked Fenie.</p>

<p>"Lots&mdash;just lots. I'm going to have 'em if I
don't&mdash;oh, I nearly told."</p>

<p>"Told what?"</p>

<p>"Why, that&mdash;oh, Dolls! Dolls! Dolls! There."</p>

<p>"Trif," exclaimed Fenie, "I do believe the
child has lost her senses."</p>

<p>"Oh, no I haven't, but&mdash;Dolls! Dolls! Dolls!"</p>

<p>"Trixy,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fenie, do be quiet," exclaimed Trif.
"Trixy, run down to the table and tell our
waiter we will be there very soon, so he may
have the oysters ready for us. Hurry, dear."</p>

<p>No sooner was Trixy out of the room than
Trif said:</p>

<p>"Fenie, you silly girl, can't you ever see anything?
I suspected it last night, but now I am
sure of it."</p>

<p>"Sure of what?"</p>

<p>"Why, that Kate and Jermyn are at an
understanding&mdash;or sure to be. I saw when Kate

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>

rejoined us last night that something unusual
had happened, and that it was not unpleasant.
She acted just as I&mdash;as I felt when Phil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" exclaimed Fenie, going quickly
into some day-dreams of her own, for she and
Harry were getting along capitally together.
They were not engaged, but there could be no
mistake as to what the dear fellow meant, and
what she wanted him to mean. She did not
speak another word while preparing for breakfast,
for she wouldn't for worlds have told what
was in her mind&mdash;not even to her sister&mdash;yet she
feared she would tell it if she spoke at all. But
wasn't it delightful? She would marry Harry,
in the course of time, and Kate would marry
Jermyn. She wondered which couple would be
first at the altar. What a delightful party of
friends they would be, the two couples, with
Trif and Phil!</p>

<p>The girl's reverie was so delightful that even
breakfast did not destroy it, although she had
the healthy appetite to which young women have
an inherent right. She took the customary
morning walk along the beach with Trif and
Trixy, but there was an expectant look in her
eye which Trif told herself would delight Harry
when he saw it. Trixy tried to talk with her,
but got such vague replies that she gave up in
despair and began to throw pebbles. Finally
the sisters seated themselves on the piazza, and
Trif began to wish she knew all that she suspected,
for she longed to write her husband all
about it. There was no sentimental nonsense
in her mind about the handsome soldier who

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>

had once hoped for her heart and hand; but
what good woman does not rejoice to see an
honest admirer happily married&mdash;after she herself
had married happily?</p>

<p>The longer she thought of it the surer she was
that her intuitions were correct, so she said she
must go and write a line to dear Phil. Fenie
accompanied her, but when Trif reached her
room Fenie was invisible, for the girl had caught
a glimpse of Kate in one of the halls, and had
hurried toward her. Fenie was thinking about
Kate and Jermyn, so she put her arm about
Kate, drew her into a parlor in which there
chanced to be no one else, kissed her, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You darling girl, I'm so happy about it!"</p>

<p>"So am I, dear," Kate replied, returning
Fenie's endearments in kind; "but I do think
Harry might have said something to me, after
all that I have done for him."</p>

<p>"Harry?" said Fenie, with a wondering look.
"Doesn't he approve of the match?"</p>

<p>"Approve? My dear girl, how could he have
made it if he hadn't thought well of it? How
strangely you talk!"</p>

<p>"He made it? The sly rogue! He and I
have chatted together for hours every day, but I
didn't imagine that anything of the sort was on
his mind."</p>

<p>"Tryphena Wardlow!" exclaimed Kate.
"Will you tell me what you are talking about?"</p>

<p>"About you and Lieutenant Jermyn, to be
sure."</p>

<p>"Oh, Fenie!" Kate flushed deeply before

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>

she continued: "He and I have become pleasantly
acquainted, and I esteem him very highly,
but can you imagine for a moment that I am
anything more than the acquaintance of a gentleman
whom I never saw until this week? How
did you get so crazy a fancy?"</p>

<p>Fenie went down into the valley of humiliation,
and said she was sure she didn't know, unless
something that Trixy had said&mdash;no, something
that Trixy hadn't said&mdash;that is, Trixy had
behaved so strangely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't believe," said Kate frigidly, "that if
the cases were reversed I would attach any
importance to the babble of a child. In the circumstances,
I think I ought to be told what
Trixy did say, for she talks with every one, and
I should like to know whether it is safe for me
to remain here any longer. I supposed it was
safe for me to be here with your sister as chaperone,
but so long as she has her dreadful child
with her no one's reputation is safe. I shall return
home at once. Fortunately Harry's business
which brought him to Norfolk is finished,
so there is no reason for our remaining here any
longer."</p>

<p>Fenie burst into tears, but Kate had her own
trouble to think of, so she remained indignant.
She recalled what Trixy had repeated the night
before, as having been said by some officer; she
herself had been too&mdash;well, too surprised and
embarrassed at the moment, and too exhilarated
a moment or two later, to think about the first
cause of what passed between her and Jermyn,
but she certainly was not going to remain where
her name could give occupation to idle tongues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Fee," exclaimed Trixy, appearing suddenly
at the door of the parlor, "I've been lookin'
everywhere for you. Mamma asked me to
find you for her."</p>

<p>"Trixy," asked Kate, "what silly things have
you been saying about me?"</p>

<p>"Not any. Every time I was goin' to say
anythin' I just said 'Dolls' instead. Didn't I,
Aunt Fee?"</p>

<p>"Then how did your aunt know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, are you all here?" exclaimed Trif, entering
the parlor. "I only sent for you, Fenie,
to let you know that I am going to write my letter
on the piazza instead of in my room; 'tis so
much pleasanter out of doors. Don't you&mdash;why,
my dear sister, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>The girl, who was thinking only of the impending
departure of the young man who was
all the world to her, hurried from the room, followed
by Trixy. Kate began at once to complain
to Trif of the child's telling&mdash;she knew
not what, and that was the dreadful thing
about it. When Trif learned what Kate's fears
and suspicions were she said:</p>

<p>"Trixy has told nothing; she has had nothing
to tell. If any one is to blame, it is I, who
could not help imagining, and hoping too, and
talking to my sister about it. If there's nothing
to it I shall be dreadfully unhappy, for Jermyn
is much the finest unmarried man of my
acquaintance, and you are the only woman I
know who is entirely worthy of him."</p>

<p>"Aunt Fee's cryin' awful, mamma," said
Trixy, returning to the parlor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Trif looked reproachfully at Kate, who showed
signs of relenting, although she was having a
severe struggle with her pride.</p>

<p>"When are you goin' to Norfolk to get my
dolls?" asked Trixy.</p>

<p>Kate laughed, despite herself; Trif embraced
her and whispered something which made Kate
blush, look toward Trixy, and say:</p>

<p>"Run quickly, dear, and tell Aunt Fee that
I've been real unkind, and that&mdash;for her sake,
I won't return to New York until&mdash;oh, I don't
know when."</p>

<span class="small">COWARDS BOTH.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">IF human nature could be as thoroughly
ashamed of its misdeeds as it sometimes is
of doings entirely to its credit, the world would
be much the better for it.</p>

<p>Kate Trewman was very sure, after her interview
with Trif, Fenie and Trixy, that she had
never done or said anything the night before
that was not entirely womanly and honest, but
the mere thought of meeting Jermyn face to face
in broad daylight made her tremble as abjectly
as if she were a criminal and Jermyn an officer
of the law. She determined to keep her room
all day; when dusk came she would go down
to the piazza with Trif and Fenie, and then if
Jermyn joined them, as she ardently hoped he
would, he could not see in her face all that she
felt her heart was putting there.</p>

<p>By a coincidence, not entirely odd, Jermyn
was feeling very like Kate. He felt that he had
acted hastily, although he could not see what
else there was for a gentleman to do in the circumstances
into which that dreadful Trixy had
forced him. Fortunately the duties of the section-room
would absorb him for some hours, but
afterwards&mdash;what? It had been his custom for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>

two years to spend an hour or two each day at
the hotel, chatting with old acquaintances and
forming new ones, but he could not trust himself
to-day.</p>

<p>He recalled some romantic affairs of his
earlier days, and the embarrassment of some
meetings, and he persuaded himself that it was
entirely for Kate's sake that he did not wish to
encounter her suddenly that morning. But what
could he do? Ha! He had it. He would run
up to Norfolk and be measured for the new uniform
which he had long been promising himself.
The general commanding the department was
soon to make his annual official visit to the
fort; there would be an inspection and parade
which should, if possible, exceed any of the
weekly affairs, and if the Trewmans remained
until that time, as he hoped they might, he
would like to appear to the best possible advantage
before the one woman in the world.</p>

<p>The Norfolk boat chanced to be very slow
that morning, and as the weather was quite
warm Jermyn made his way as far forward as
possible to get the air. Most of the other passengers
had done likewise, but Jermyn found a
vacant chair near some brother officers and
made haste to take it. Two or three minutes
later he saw, seated very near him, and
reading as industriously as if her book were the
most interesting in the world, Kate Trewman.
Kate well knew who was seated near her, but
she could not help looking shyly toward him.</p>

<p>"What a delightful surprise!" said Jermyn,
bravely, as he moved his chair toward Kate's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very kind of you," Kate murmured. "I had
some shopping to do, and as my brother has
already made me acquainted with some of the
business streets, and as I could not persuade
him to accompany me, I ventured alone. The
truth is, I promised Trixy Highwood some dolls
before I left New York, and she reminded me of
them yesterday, and I think 'tis dreadfully cruel
to disappoint a child&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, when the child chances to be
so interesting as Trixy." Jermyn cudgelled his
wits a moment before continuing: "May I ask
whether you know the ways of Norfolk shops?
Some of the dealers regard Northern people as
specially desirable prey, but there are others who
make special concessions to us people of the
fort. Won't you let me make you acquainted
with some of them? After that, you may banish
me when you will."</p>

<p>"You are very kind. Oh, Mr. Jermyn, weren't
these waters the scene of that wonderful fight
between the Merrimac and the Monitor?"</p>

<p>Jermyn immediately began the story of the historic
naval engagement, and that Kate might see
the localities more clearly he borrowed a glass
from the pilot, and he begged permission to
steady Kate's arm while she used the glass&mdash;the
old boat trembled so provokingly, he said, and
Kate herself admitted that she never had been
on a boat whose deck was more unsteady, so Jermyn
continued to assist her until nothing remained
to be seen but the docks of Norfolk.
Then he escorted her to two or three shops, making
every possible excuse to remain with her.
Finally, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you mind my remaining with you
while you select those dolls? I used to have to
buy such things, when my sisters were younger,
and it would give me great pleasure to recall the
sensation."</p>

<p>Kate could not refuse a request made in such
terms, so the couple were soon having much
amusement in discussing the utterly inhuman
features which manufacturers succeed in imposing
upon dolls. The selection consumed much
time; meanwhile there came into the shop an officer's
wife, newly arrived at the fort, who asked
Jermyn if he might be going to the navy-yard,
across the river, for she had come from an interior
town where naval vessels never had been
seen, and she did long to look at some, if only
for a moment or two, and Jermyn said he would
be delighted to escort her to and through the
yard, where he knew every one, and he asked
Kate whether she would not accompany them?</p>

<p>Kate did not say "No"; she was by that time
in a frame of mind which would have made her
equal to tramping through mud for the sake of
having Jermyn beside her. While at the yard,
she noted with delight the heartiness with which
all the naval officers greeted Jermyn. Trif had
whispered to her, only a few hours before, that
she herself had once been almost in love with
Jermyn, and that she still believed no other
bachelor alive was his equal, but Kate had been
a woman long enough to attach more importance
to men's opinions of men than to women's.
Luncheon was served for the party on one of
the war vessels, and each lady was toasted, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>

Kate noted that when her own name was given,
Jermyn drained his glass with a look at her
which made her feel uncomfortable yet happy.</p>

<p>The party returned to Old Point by a boat
which did not reach the pier until after dark,
and as the officer's wife had never before been
in Norfolk alone her husband was at the pier,
in much anxiety, to look for her, and escort her
home, and the pier was so covered with freight
that Jermyn thought it his duty to insist that
Kate should take his arm, which he held very
closely to his side without any remonstrance
from the owner, and then he insisted upon finding
her brother or Trif before he left her.</p>

<p>"'Tis all right," whispered Trif to Fenie, as
she saw them approaching.</p>

<p>"About the dolls?" asked Trixy, anxiously.
"Do you think them's in the bundle that he's
carryin'?"</p>

<p>"No, you silly child!" said Fenie. "Your
mother means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fenie received a warning pinch, but it was too
late, for the child exclaimed: "Oh, I know!"
and made a sudden dash in the direction of the
approaching couple. Trif snatched at Trixy's
dress; there was a ripping, tearing sound, and
away went the child, while behind her floated
something like a train.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad!" she exclaimed, stopping
before Jermyn and Kate so suddenly as to separate
them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kate. "Here are the dolls,
dear."</p>

<p>"I'm awful glad to get 'em; my, what a big
bundle! But that wasn't what I meant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"What else?" asked Kate, in entire innocence.</p>

<p>"Why, that you're bein' nice to Mr. Jermyn.
Mamma and Aunt Fee have been talkin' about
you all day, and hopin' you wouldn't be a
fool&mdash;that's what they said; I never say such
things about a lady&mdash;no indeed! Say, you're
engaged, aren't you? 'Cause&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take the package to your mother, Trixy,
and let her open it for you," said Jermyn
quickly. "Miss Trewman, please don't hurry
away; do take my arm again, just for a moment;
thank you. I merely wished to say&mdash;shall we
walk a moment?&mdash;to say that our friends seem
to take unusual interest in us; interest of a kind
which I'm sure neither of us has said a word to
justify."</p>

<p>"Not a word, I'm sure," assented Kate.</p>

<p>"But I can't endure," continued Jermyn rapidly,
"to risk, merely through the prattle of a
child, the most delightful friendship I ever
made. Last night I said to you&mdash;but why
repeat it? I've no right to expect you to endure
any annoyance, for my sake, but if you chance
to like me as much as last night you let me
think you do, can't we afford to make light of
such chatter as that provoking child may inflict
upon us? Good men are plentiful&mdash;better men
than I; but to me there is only one woman in all
the world, and I can't bear the thought of giving
up hope of her until she herself commands me.
I assure you that I am entirely in earnest."</p>

<p>"I couldn't suspect you of flirting," said Kate,
softly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Jermyn, pressing closely to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>

his side the little hand which was trembling on
his arm. "I won't ask you for any promises,
except that you will allow yourself to become well
acquainted with me. You are with friends who
love you dearly, and one of them knows me of
old. There can be nothing to cause embarrassment
between us, except&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except Trixy?" interrupted Kate, with a
silvery laugh.</p>

<p>"Bless you for laughing about it!" said Jermyn,
earnestly. "If you can continue to do so,
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One can get accustomed to almost anything,"
said Kate, with another laugh, although
why she laughed she was sure she did not
know.</p>

<p>"If 'can' could mean 'will,' and if I could be
'anything'&mdash;" said Jermyn. He did not complete
the sentence, so Kate looked shyly up at
him. They had walked so far that they were
beyond the lights of the hotel, but the girl could
see that her companion's face, always strong and
earnest, seemed intently fixed upon something
far ahead. They had walked all the way to the
little lighthouse, and just beyond it, and there
are few darker places than the base of a lighthouse.
The darkness gave Kate courage, so
she whispered:</p>

<p>"It shall mean 'will,' if you wish it so."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you!" Then&mdash;what strange
influences there are in darkness!&mdash;Jermyn threw
his arms about Kate and kissed her.</p>

<p>Some student of love has said that kisses gain
force by delay. Jermyn's was the first kiss Kate

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>

Trewman had ever received from a man who
professed to love her, so between astonishment
and many other things which she did not understand
and could not have called up and thought
about at the time had her life depended upon it,
she did not resist the kiss nor the several that
followed it.</p>

<p>"My angel!" said Jermyn. "You will be my
wife?"</p>

<p>"How can I help it?" asked Kate, softly,
"after&mdash;after what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" sounded a child's voice behind
them.</p>

<p>"Trixy!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to do nothin'," the child explained.
"I was just walkin' along behind you,
'cause you both looked so splendid, and walked
so nice together, but when you kissed each
other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trixy!" exclaimed Kate, "I did nothing of
the sort!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you? Then I don't think you was
very polite."</p>

<span class="small">THE COURAGE OF JOY.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME of the least explicable changes of
manner are the most genuine, so it is not
necessary to assign any reason for the fact that
on the way back to the hotel Jermyn and Kate,
who had both been under considerable restraint
a few moments before, talked as freely and rapidly
as if they had been acquainted for years.
The only indication that there was more than
one thought between them was the care with
which they kept Trixy in sight and reach, so
that her little tongue could not wag until it had
been put under proper curb by Trixy's mother.
On the other hand, they kept her far enough
from them for her not to overhear anything that
they were saying to each other, and their frequent
recalls, whenever the child attempted to
skip or run, had the effect of soon making Trixy
appear as if she were a prisoner under close
guard.</p>

<p>Even when the hotel was reached the child
was kept within view yet out of hearing, while
Jermyn and Kate sat down with Trif. Fortunately
for them, Harry and Fenie just then
thought of some one whom they wanted to find
in the ball-room, and they were glad of some
one who would keep Trif from being alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Jermyn began with military directness by saying:</p>

<p>"Miss Trewman, may I ask one of my oldest
friends to congratulate me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Kate replied, "if you will let her include
me in the congratulations."</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear people!" exclaimed Trif.
"There's nothing that I would rather have
heard."</p>

<p>"You don't think it shockingly sudden?"
asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Not I&mdash;considering what either of you might
have missed by delay."</p>

<p>"I assure you," said Kate, "that not a word
would have been said about it for months&mdash;it all
came so suddenly&mdash;if it hadn't been for Trixy."</p>

<p>"Where is that child?" asked Jermyn, rising
in alarm and looking in every direction.</p>

<p>"She's looking at her dolls," Trif replied.
"No, she isn't. Dear me! I arranged those
dolls for her on a chair not ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Not ten minutes ago?" asked Jermyn
dreamily.</p>

<p>"It seems ten hours ago&mdash;ten days," whispered
Kate dreamily.</p>

<p>"My dear children," said Trif, although Kate
was only three years younger than she and Jermyn
was older by several years, "you ought to
be the happiest people alive, except Phil and I;
but to keep the matter to ourselves for a while,
if only to divert attention and prevent impertinent
curiosity while Kate is down here&mdash;you
know how some of the best of people will talk&mdash;don't
tell any one&mdash;although I'm sure that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
must tell Fenie, who can't help telling Harry,
but no one else need know."</p>

<p>"But, my dear madam," said Jermyn, once
more rising and peering earnestly in every direction,
"your interesting daughter already knows.
I do wish I knew where to look for her."</p>

<p>"Trixy knows? How on earth did she
learn?"</p>

<p>"Tell her&mdash;if you can," said Kate to Jermyn.</p>

<p>"I am sure that you would do it more gracefully,"
said Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Oh," began Kate, "we were walking along
the beach, talking about&mdash;never mind what. I
hadn't the faintest idea how far we were from
the hotel, and the first thing I knew we were
near the lighthouse, and I didn't know that any
one else was anywhere near us&mdash;indeed, I didn't
think. Just then Mr. Jermyn&mdash;oh, the artfulness
of some men&mdash;Mr. Jermyn&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He suddenly recognized Miss Trewman as
his superior officer for all time, and he made the
salute which custom has sanctioned for such
occasions," interrupted Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Very gracefully done," murmured Kate with
a tender look.</p>

<p>"What?&mdash;the salute? Your remark encourages
me to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you horrid fellow; the explanation."</p>

<p>"But what has this to do with Trixy?" asked
Trif.</p>

<p>"Only this; it seems that she had been following
us all the while, and she heard it."</p>

<p>Trif pursed her lips a moment, and laughed
before she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose that soldiers are so accustomed to
noisy salutes that they don't always think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Kate, "I'm sure she didn't hear
the kiss, because I didn't, and I think&mdash;oh,
Trif, you're too mean for anything! To make
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think I made some remarks afterward,"
said Jermyn, "but they were interrupted by a
shout of 'Hurrah,' and on looking around we
saw Trixy."</p>

<p>"She shan't trouble you again!" exclaimed
Trif. "I'll take her home&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Please don't!" exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p>"How could you be so cruel?" asked Jermyn.</p>

<p>"You inconsistent, incomprehensible couple.
A moment ago you were complaining that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But haven't you any mercy for Harry and
Fenie?" asked Kate. "They are so ecstatically
happy here."</p>

<p>"Quite right, my dear!" said Jermyn gravely.
"Harry and Fenie, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"But they can see each other in New York
quite as well as if they were here," argued Trif.</p>

<p>"But what is to become of me?" asked Kate.
"If you go home, Fenie will go with you, and
Harry will want to hurry after, and I can't remain
here alone, and you are the only married woman
of my acquaintance who is here, and who
knows."</p>

<p>"My dear girl!" exclaimed Trif. "I beg a
thousand pardons. Let me see; what can I do?
I don't see what, except to caution Trixy very
carefully; and as she is the most conscientious
little thing in the world, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the leakiest," added Kate.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Kate! I won't have the dear child
maligned. She never tells anything she is
ordered not to&mdash;unless she is asked. I shall
tell her that she will make great unhappiness
for two people who love her dearly if she says
anything to anybody about anything which she
has heard or&mdash;ahem!&mdash;seen this evening. Of
course, no one will question her, for no one has
any reason to suspect anything, and, of course,
nothing in the manner of either of you will give
any ground for curiosity."</p>

<p>"'Twould be awful&mdash;simply too awful,"
moaned Kate, "if anyone should learn what has
happened on so short acquaintance. Beside,
I'd be the principal sufferer, whereas it wasn't
in the least particular my fault."</p>

<p>"'Twas all your fault, my dear," protested
Jermyn. "If you hadn't been the most incomparable
woman in all the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't forget," interrupted Kate, "that
we are not alone."</p>

<p>"I'll take Trixy aside at once," said Trif,
"and caution her thoroughly."</p>

<p>"You will make us everlastingly your debtors,"
said Jermyn. "Let me find her for you."</p>

<p>While the young man was absent, the two
women talked as rapidly and earnestly and
ecstatically as only women can talk about the
most important event&mdash;but one&mdash;that can befall
one of their sex. Almost as soon as Jermyn
returned with the child, an orderly from the
fort appeared with the word that the officer was
wanted at his company quarters, so Jermyn bade
a reluctant adieu, and hurried away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>As he passed through the postern gate of the
fort, he met an officer who seemed to be looking
for some one, and who exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hurry along, old fellow! Every one is waiting
impatiently."</p>

<p>"Every one waiting? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"You'll learn in a moment."</p>

<p>"Has some high government official died, and
are all the troops at the fort to attend the
funeral?"</p>

<p>"No such bad luck; at any rate, you won't
have to go into mourning." So saying, the
officer led Jermyn into the club, where the
wondering man found several officers of his own
rank, and all bachelors. As Jermyn entered, all
arose, with glasses in their hands, and one of
them shouted:</p>

<p>"Here's Jermyn!"</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" shouted the others in chorus,
after which each man drained his glass and
refilled it. Then some one shouted:</p>

<p>"Hats, off gentlemen! Here's 'Her!'"</p>

<p>"Her!" responded the chorus, and again the
glasses were drained.</p>

<p>"What are you fellows talking about?" asked
Jermyn, with a savage frown.</p>

<p>"Don't lose your temper, old fellow," said one
of the party. "You know that we're not given to
prying into the personal affairs of our comrades,
but this information came to us unsought."</p>

<p>"Not only unsought," said Lieutenant Prewser,
"but we did all in our power to avoid getting
it&mdash;didn't we, Groston?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we did. We tried to change the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
subject of conversation, or, more properly speaking,
of report, but she wouldn't have it. She
got back to it every time, and she stuck to it
until she had her say."</p>

<p>"She? Who?"</p>

<p>"Trixy."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" muttered Jermyn, while his face
became very red.</p>

<p>"The accused displays the customary sign of
guilt," remarked the oldest officer of the party.</p>

<p>"Really, Jermyn," said Prewser, "I never met
anyone who was more determined to talk. If
I'd been alone I wouldn't have said anything
about it, but as there were three of us, and we
all tried to dissuade her, and she persisted in
offering circumstantial evidence&mdash;ahem!&mdash;too
strong to be set aside, we thought it only fair
that we, who have fought and bled and died
with you, or expect to do so, should be the first
to congratulate you. To think of all the women
who've angled for you, yet whom you've escaped!
And you've made such a glorious capture,
too! If we hadn't agreed that there should
be only two toasts on this happy occasion, I
should be in favor of our drinking also to
Trixy."</p>

<p>"Confound her!" exclaimed Jermyn, thinking
only of Kate's feelings should Trixy have talked
further before he captured her and led her to
her mother, "are you fellows so foolish as to
attach any importance to what a child like that
may say?"</p>

<p>"Does the accused desire that the evidence
shall be reviewed, item by item, in his pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>ence?"
asked some one. "Only three of us
have heard it, but if the accused himself insists&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" Jermyn roared.</p>

<p>"Your secret is safe with us, old fellow," said
Prewser, "as you know well, so forgive us if
we've been a little effusive in our rejoicing for
your sake. Go to your quarters and to happy
dreams. Jove! how I envy you!"</p>

<p>"So&mdash;so say we all of us," repeated the others
in unison, as Jermyn beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>The miseries which Jermyn wished Trixy during
the short walk from the club to his quarters
quite out-Heroded Herod. Once fairly by himself,
however, his joy banished his anger. Let
the boys laugh among themselves! They all
envied him, didn't they say so? How could he
ever sleep, after so exciting an evening? What
had he ever done that he should be so richly
blessed as he would be with Kate Trewman for
his wife?</p>

<p>There must have been a special Providence
watching over him in other days when he
thought himself in love, even when he failed to
win Tryphosa Wardlow, and, within a few days&mdash;how
long passed they seemed!&mdash;when he
could not keep the face of Trif's pretty sister
out of his mind, and wouldn't have done so if he
could!</p>

<p>But how very long the coming night would
be! He had known long nights while on picket,
when his battery was on duty in the Indian
country and he had looked forward to them
with dread, but now there would be twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
hours, at the very least, before he could again
gaze upon the face of the woman who was all
the world to him. What could he do to pass
the time? Study?&mdash;bosh! Read? No; he
must sleep, for he owed it to Kate to appear his
very best the next day. Still, it was only ten
o'clock; he never retired before eleven. He
would read a little while; read some poetry&mdash;something
he had done but little in late years.</p>

<p>He had read but a few minutes when there
was a knock at the door and a servant handed
him a letter addressed in writing which he did
not recognize. He opened it and read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We return to New York by the morning train. You had scarcely left us
when two ladies whom I've known only two or three days came to tell
me how glad they were of the news. When I learned what they meant I
expressed surprise, but they said that every one in the hotel knew
of it&mdash;some one had overheard Trixy talking of it to two or three
officers. That child!</p>

<p class="center">Sorrowfully,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Kate</span>.</p

<span class="small">THE WOOING O' IT.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a lot of misery&mdash;four rooms full
of it&mdash;when Kate Trewman announced to
the Highwood party and her brother that she
could never, never, never again face the gossips
and the other people at the hotel after the story
of her engagement had got about with the infinity
of detail which Trixy had imparted and the
additions which are inevitable when a story is
passed from lip to lip. Trif had promised to go
sailing the very next day with some new friends,
Fenie had promised several dances for the
"Ladies' Night" at the fort, which would be
the next night but one, and Harry and Fenie
had agreed to make a little trip which Harry
thought would be peculiarly delightful, and
Fenie agreed with him, although she did not
know why.</p>

<p>But Kate was obdurate. She admitted to
Trif that she loved Jermyn dearly, strange
though it might seem, but for that very reason
her self-respect was stronger than ever, and
although she could endure anything for her own
sake she was not willing that anything should
occur, or that anything which had occurred,
should make the dear fellow laughed at and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>

talked about. People were so mean! Who
knew but some one would say that she had tried
to catch him, and succeeded? The idea!</p>

<p>"But Kate," argued Trif, "there's no need of
your being seen if you'll consent to remain a
day or two longer. You've only to remain in
your room while I make my sailing trip with my
friends, and Harry and Fenie have their little
outing. You won't be alone; think of the delightful
thoughts that will keep you company!
The day after my trip I'll make a special
luncheon in my room, in honor of the happy
couple, and it will be entirely right, as your
brother will bring Jermyn. You certainly
couldn't be so heartless as to depart without
seeing him once more, and without letting him
see you."</p>

<p>"Do you think it would be heartless&mdash;do you
think it would seem so to him?"</p>

<p>"It certainly would, to him or to any other
good man, under the circumstances," Trif replied,
with extreme New England positiveness.</p>

<p>"Then I will remain," said Kate; upon which
Trif kissed her and called her a dear good girl,
and Fenie kissed her and called her a sensible
girl, and Harry kissed her and said she was a
good sister, and Trixy offered to kiss her but
was rudely pushed away.</p>

<p>Jermyn knew nothing of this conversation.
He had done much desperate thinking after receiving
Kate's note, and one consequence was
that he looked across the parade ground, saw
that lights were still burning in the adjutant's
office and the home of the post commandant, so

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>

he hurried over to the adjutant and made an
application for leave of absence for a week, on
important personal business. The post adjutant
looked astonished, for leaves of absence in the
army are charged against the month's leave
which each officer is allowed once a year in time
of peace, and the adjutant knew well that Jermyn
had been carefully "saving his time" for
a month's run to the Pacific Coast during the
coming summer. Still, Jermyn pleaded urgency,
and begged for an immediate decision; and the
post commandant, who was a large-hearted
gentleman, and also a close observer of the
individual members of his command, granted
the leave; so the next morning, very early, before
any one at the hotel was stirring, Jermyn invaded
a lighthouse boat which he knew was to go to
Norfolk very early. His plan was to get upon
the steamer which started from Norfolk for the
train, miles away, touching at Old Point <i>en route</i>.
Neither Kate nor her brother should know of
his proximity until the train started; after that,&mdash;well,
Kate could not be other than the woman
he thought her, so she would be glad to see
him, and her brother, beside being a gentleman,
was himself in love; so he would certainly give
the couple some opportunities for conversation
during the trip to New York.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the Admiral, who
had been somewhat upset by his exciting
experience of two or three preceding days,
and had been restoring himself by a veteran
seaman's favorite remedy, rest, got out of his
room very early, and sauntered about the beach

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

in search of a proper appetite for breakfast. It
did not help him much to meet Jermyn and
hear the young man's story of disappointment,
yet he heartily approved of the fellow's spirit
and wished him the happy time which undoubtedly
would be his. The excitement caused by
the interview gave the old gentleman the appetite
for which he longed, so he went in at once
to breakfast, at which he lingered long.</p>

<p>As he sat at table, the train-boat from Norfolk
came in, and the Admiral looked through the
window toward the pier, hoping for a glimpse of
Kate. Evidently she had escaped him, for she
was not with any of the parties which moved
down from the hotel; probably she was already
in the crowd, which always is an hour in advance
of starting time, and he did not like to bid a
lady good-bye when there were all sorts of people
around to hear what was said.</p>

<p>As the boat cast off and started for Cape
Charles, the southern terminus of the railway,
the old gentleman raised his coffee-cup to his
lips, and murmured:</p>

<p>"God bless them!"</p>

<p>"Who's you a-blessin'?" asked Trixy, who
had entered the breakfast-room and had been
moving by circuitous lines to "s'prise" the
Admiral.</p>

<p>"Why, Trixy! Good morning! I've not seen
you for several days. Do sit down and take
some breakfast with me. Tell me some news."</p>

<p>"There ain't no news," said Trixy. "Yes there
is too; but mamma says I mustn't ever tell any
more news until I'm a big woman. And I can't

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>

take breakfast just now, 'cause I just was sent
down to ask the waiter to send Miss Trewman's
breakfast up to her room, 'specially a cup of
coffee."</p>

<p>"Miss Trewman's breakfast? Why&mdash;Miss
Trewman has gone to New York."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, she hasn't. She changed her mind.
Mamma made her do it."</p>

<p>"Trixy, do you mean to say," asked the Admiral,
as he arose hastily from the table, "that Miss
Trewman isn't on the boat which started for the
train at Cape Charles?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say she's up in her room," Trixy
replied, "for I just came from there and I saw
her. She said she wanted that coffee awfully,
too, so I mustn't wait any longer to see the waiter;
but I'll come back in a minute and take some
breakfast with you, if you like."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;er," stammered the Admiral, who had
been thinking rapidly and looking at the lighthouse
tug, which was already steaming back
from Norfolk, "suppose we hold the engagement
over until to-morrow morning? The truth is,
I've practically finished my own breakfast, so I
wouldn't be proper company. Besides, I've just
thought of something which ought to be attended
to this instant."</p>

<p>"All right," said Trixy. "I'm goin' to have
one comp'ny meal to-day anyway, cause mamma's
goin' to give a splendid little dinner in her
room to Miss Trewman and Mr. Jermyn."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Excuse me, my dear, but I must
hurry."</p>

<p>The Admiral hurried out of the room, and,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>

despite his years and his dignity, ran toward
"The Hole," a sheltered portion of the harbor
where small craft usually anchored. He got as
near as possible to the lighthouse tug, and waved
his handkerchief violently. Just as the anchor
of the tug dropped, a sailor reported to the officer
in charge:</p>

<p>"Signal from the shore, sir!"</p>

<p>"Don't notice it," was the reply, made gruffly.
"Hang the impertinence of some of these spring
visitors."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I think it's Admiral Allison a-signallin',
sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's different! Lower away! I'll go
ashore for him."</p>

<p>The tug's boat had scarcely touched the beach
when the Admiral gave the prow a mighty shove
and shouted, "Shove off! Give way!" first
wetting his feet thoroughly. Then he sprang
like a cat from thwart to thwart until he got aft
and dropped beside the astonished officer, whispering:</p>

<p>"Charley, you were at the Naval Academy
while I was on duty there!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Admiral, and you were the best friend
I ever had there. I couldn't have pulled through
if it hadn't been for you, as you well know!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so, my dear boy, for I
want some special help from you to-day. Up
anchor, and let me catch that train for New
York."</p>

<p>"Why, Admiral, you know what a slow old
tub this is, and we've been blowing off steam."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Help me to catch that train.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>

Burn out a boiler, if necessary, and charge it to
me. I'll stand a court-martial rather than lose
that train."</p>

<p>Within five minutes the tug was rounding the
pier in front of the hotel and the Admiral was
compounding a prescription which is highly
esteemed at sea by elderly gentlemen who are
suffering from great excitement and wet feet.
Black smoke poured so densely from the boat's
single funnel that a naval officer who was enjoying
a brief outing at the hotel and had got out
of bed early to enjoy as much as possible of it,
told his wife that probably a buoy had strayed
from its moorings somewhere and some sea-captain
had been complaining by telegraph to
the authorities at Washington.</p>

<p>The chase was a hard one; the train-boat had
fully ten minutes the start of the tug, but the
Admiral, who stood forward ready to hurry
ashore, remarked that it usually took fully ten
minutes to get all the passengers, luggage and
freight from the boat to the train. When finally
he went over the side he said:</p>

<p>"Charley, keep your eye on the rear platform.
If I wave my handkerchief you'll know I'm
safely aboard. Then wait as long as the train
does; if it starts at once, steam along up the bay
until you see it stop. I'll get the conductor to
pull up and let us off."</p>

<p>"Us?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Jermyn and me."</p>

<p>It was none of the young officer's business, as
he told himself, but he could not help wondering
what was up between the Admiral and Jermyn.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>

He saw the old gentleman scramble upon the
rear platform of the last car, and at that very
instant the train started, so the tug's nose was
put up Chesapeake Bay, while her commander
told himself that the chasing of a big ferry boat
by a small tug was a sort of service for which
boats of the lighthouse service were not designed,
and that the next time the Admiral wanted anything
of the sort done, and wanted a locomotive
chased afterward, he hoped there would be a
torpedo boat in the harbor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Admiral was making his way
through the train in search of Jermyn, while the
latter, moving from front to rear, was looking
for Kate. The two men met suddenly in the
vestibule between two cars.</p>

<p>"Admiral!" exclaimed Jermyn. "Are you too
going to New York?"</p>

<p>"Not this time, dear boy. Neither are you.
She's changed her mind&mdash;Miss Trewman&mdash;she's
still at the hotel. Where's the conductor?
Hang it, Charley will never be able to catch us
if we go on at this rate. Where's the bell-rope?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman, who was quite short,
sprang lightly upward, blew two long blasts, and
the train began to slow. The Admiral opened
the vestibule door and said:</p>

<p>"Come on! We'll have to jump."</p>

<p>Jump they did, and into some Eastern Shore
mud which did not harmonize with the attire of
either gentleman. As they floundered out of it,
screened from the train by some scrubby bushes,
the tug, which had heard the locomotive's stopping

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>

signal, blew three long blasts of her own
whistle. Long before she steamed abreast of
the part of the beach which the runaways had
reached, the Admiral was waving his handkerchief
so wildly that Jermyn insisted upon relieving
him to spare him the pangs of a stiff shoulder
and the danger of apoplexy.</p>

<span class="small">THE MISSING GUEST.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">AS Trif was a prudent wife and housekeeper,
she had been moaning to herself for days
about the expense of the Southern trip. Nevertheless,
she arranged for a lunch party regardless
of expense, as befitted an occasion when
two happy couples, newly made so, were to be
her guests. She promised herself that she
would pay for it by not buying a single new
article of clothing, not even a new frock, for the
coming season. She would economize in any
and every way; she would let her house, furnished,
for a few months, and take Trixy and
Fenie and herself to some out-of-the-way place
where everything was cheap, and the other
boarders would not know her old clothes from
the newest. Further, as she would have to send
home for more money, she sat down and wrote
an ecstatic confession to her husband, telling
him that she really thought it her duty, as a
member of society, to complete the matches
which were as good as made between Harry
and Fenie, Kate and Jermyn.</p>

<p>Then she sent to Jermyn such a note as only
a great-hearted, good-hearted woman could write,
after which she insisted on helping to array Kate

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>

as a queen should be dressed for her formal coronation.
She was as earnest as she was sentimental,
so she talked so strongly as well as
romantically to Kate that the latter grew sweeter
and handsomer every moment, until finally she
felt as if the occasion would be one of consecration
instead of a mere meeting with the man
who already seemed a very old acquaintance.</p>

<p>Trif told her she looked like a goddess, a sacrifice,
an angel, a queen&mdash;everything a good
woman could be while trying to devote her love
and life to a worthy man. Trif had been telling
her, and Kate was in a condition of mind to
believe it, that marriages were made in heaven,
and despite all future ceremonies that might be
necessary her obligations were already recorded
above, and Kate rose to the dignity of the occasion,
and looked sweeter and felt happier,
although more humble and earnest than in all
her life before, for were not all who were to be
present quite near to her?&mdash;her brother, who
seemed in the seventh heaven of happiness;
Fenie, who appeared almost too beautiful, in
her happiness and devotion, to be merely human;
Trif, the woman who had known love for
years and rejoiced in it with a nobility surpassing
that of any other woman Kate had ever met;
and Trixy&mdash;oh, Kate could take even Trixy to
her heart. Mischief-making though the child
had been, Trixy's hands and no others should
strew flowers when the day came for Kate and
Jermyn to be made husband and wife. What
a heaven on earth this much-abused old world
was, to be sure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Kate," exclaimed Trif, reappearing for
about the twentieth time, "what do you suppose
it can mean? Before breakfast I wrote Jermyn,
asking him to lunch with us at noon, and I've
just received word that he is not at the fort. He
has gone away&mdash;gone to New York."</p>

<p>Kate almost tottered, so Trif hurried to support
her. Suddenly Kate changed her manner
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a grand fellow he is!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Trif, almost
doubting her own senses. Kate looked proud,
then pensive, after which she said softly:</p>

<p>"Last night I sent him word of what had
happened&mdash;the remarks of those inquisitive
women, you know, who got hold of what Trixy
had said, and I told him it would be necessary
for me to return&mdash;that I would go to New York
this morning. He has started at once to follow
me. I might have imagined, in advance, that he
would do exactly that. The splendid fellow!"</p>

<p>"The unhappy fellow, I should say," wailed
Trif. "There he goes, probably on the very
train he supposed you would take, and he is
looking for you, and his heart is aching as if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Kate, with the manner of a
tragedy queen. "I never, never thought of that."</p>

<p>"De lunch is served, ladies," said the colored
waiter who had been busying himself in the
room for some moments.</p>

<p>"Come along, dear," said Trif. "If you
love him as I loved Phil the day after he proposed
you'll have him in your heart very safely,
no matter how far away he may be. The more

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>

trouble you think him in, the dearer you will
love him. As to the rest of us, we will promise
to talk of him only."</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes," added Fenie, who had heard
the unwelcome news, and hastened to offer consolation.
"I won't say a word about any one
else&mdash;even about Harry."</p>

<p>"Neither will I," volunteered Trixy, who had
followed her aunt into the room. "He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You little&mdash;" interrupted Kate, moving
toward the child with vengeful gesture, but Trixy
continued:</p>

<p>"He looked so splendid last night when he
kissed you that I haven't thought of anythin'
since except the way papa kisses mamma."</p>

<p>Then both women blushed, and Fenie looked
so oddly at Harry that the young man blushed
too, but recovered sufficiently to ask Fenie
whether they shouldn't set the others a good
example by leading the way to the table.
Although very little time elapsed before the
remainder of the party followed them, Fenie was
found with brilliant roses in her cheeks, while
upon her finger was a ring which none of the
party but Harry had ever seen before, and
Harry was looking as proud as a king, and
Fenie was regarding him as if she were his
most adoring and obedient subject.</p>

<p>"If my loss," said Kate gayly, after several
significant glances from Trif had compelled her
to see the brilliant upon Fenie's hand, "has
been to the gain of any one else, or even to two
other people, I shall endeavor to endure it
bravely. I've always been sacrificing myself

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>

for my brother; I shall be glad if my long vigil
is to end."</p>

<p>So the party became quite happy despite the
missing guest, and there was so much of the
merry joking that brothers and sisters can exchange
that Fenie and Harry soon began to
talk as if they had been engaged for months
instead of moments. And how Trif, the happy
wife, and Kate, the proud betrothed, did enjoy
the spectacle! Kate, indeed, soon began to
hold herself to account for forgetting absolutely,
for at least half an hour, the loyal soul that was
vainly following her and might not be able to
find her until&mdash;when? She became very pensive
and thoughtful; Harry must find out for
her, at the fort, if possible, how to communicate
with Jermyn. She would remain at the hotel,
be stared at, talked about, anything, if only that
the man who loved her should not remain unhappy
a single moment longer than was absolutely
necessary. She thought so seriously that
Trixy finally remarked:</p>

<p>"Mamma, dear, I don't believe Miss Trewman
likes this kind of lobster."</p>

<p>"Card for you, ma'am," said the waiter suddenly
to Trif.</p>

<p>Trif took the card and read aloud:</p>

<p>"Admiral Allison; 'just for a moment.'
How odd! Perhaps, Kate, 'tis something about
Jermyn. You may say I'll be down in a moment."</p>

<p>"He's right outside de do', ma'am," the waiter
replied.</p>

<p>"The business-like way of some men!" exclaimed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>

Trif. "Still, it must be something important.
By the way, girls, the Admiral is a
delightful gentleman, and he knows the two
secrets that are in our hearts to-day, and we
have a vacant place at the table&mdash;show him in,
waiter."</p>

<p>The party arose. The Admiral entered the
room, and behind him came&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" shouted Kate. How ridiculously
thin armor is when there is a healthy heart under
it! Kate rushed at Jermyn, threw her arms
about him, and kissed him as affectionately as
if he were a long-lost relation.</p>

<p>"How did you come to be here?" she finally
asked.</p>

<p>"The Admiral brought me," Jermyn replied.</p>

<p>Then, shocking, yet truthful to relate, Kate
kissed the Admiral also. She was the taller of
the two, so she had to lean over him, but no
one laughed or seemed astonished&mdash;no one but
Trixy, who exclaimed, "My!" but no notice
was taken of it.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentleman," said the Admiral,
gravely, after the excitement had subsided a
little, and he stood with a lapel of his coat
drawn back while he drew from his pocket a
medal which hung from a clasp, "I thought
when this medal was presented to me by my
country that I had gained the highest honor of
which an American was capable, but I am now
compelled to change my opinion. Miss Trewman,
the goddess of liberty will hereafter owe
you a grudge."</p>

<p>"But, Admiral," said Kate, all blushes and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>

brilliancy, "how could you know that he had
gone, and that&mdash;that&mdash;oh, that I wanted him
back?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I chanced to meet him, very early this
morning, learned that he was going, and the
reason of his sudden departure."</p>

<p>"And you prevented him?"</p>

<p>"How could I? He said that you had gone
unexpectedly, and that he thought it his duty
to follow you. I should have felt as he did,
in similar circumstances, so I bade him God-speed."</p>

<p>"But he started. I don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did, my dear," said Jermyn, "but the Admiral,
with a special boat, chased our craft and
the train, found me, stopped the train, and
brought me back, and&mdash;here I am."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are, indeed! Admiral, you're an
angel."</p>

<p>The Admiral bowed profoundly and said:</p>

<p>"I cannot contradict a lady."</p>

<p>"But how did you know&mdash;Oh, do explain
what I'm sure none of us yet understand."</p>

<p>"The Spaniards have a saying," the old gentleman
replied, "that fortunes, like miseries
always travel in couples. While I was breakfasting
this morning, and feeling an almost impertinent
interest, I must confess, in the affairs
of an estimable couple who seemed to have encountered
contrary winds, Trixy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trixy?"</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Trewman," said Trixy, with a
troubled yet appealing face, "I didn't tell him
anything awful. He said you'd gone to New

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>

York, and I said he was mistaken, 'cause mamma
had made you change your mind, and that
mamma was goin' to give a luncheon party this
mornin' to you and Mr. Jermyn, and&mdash;and&mdash;that
was all I said&mdash;wasn't it, Admiral?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely all. Whatever has happened
since has been entirely through what Trixy
said."</p>

<p>Then Kate kissed Trixy, and told her that she
was the dearest little thing that ever was born,
and the information seemed to do the child a lot
of good. Afterward it occurred to Kate that
the man who had been the principal subject of
her thoughts during the day was getting very
little of her attention, and as the Admiral insisted
upon departing, and Harry and Fenie had
eyes only for each other, and Trif seemed entirely
happy with no one to talk to, the meal
passed delightfully although slowly to its close.
When general conversation chanced again to
begin, Fenie remarked:</p>

<p>"It does seem that none of us can have any
more misunderstandings. There never would
have been any but for Trixy, but she certainly
can do no harm in the future."</p>

<p>"Trixy certainly has learned her lesson," said
Trif.</p>

<p>"Papa says that some folks never get through
with their lessons till they die," observed Trixy,
while all the rest looked serious.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />
<span class="small">A BLISSFUL WEEK.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Highwoods and Trewmans started for
New York a few hours after the lunch-party
ended, and Jermyn accompanied them. He had
wanted to do so, from the first, but found many
difficulties in the way of saying so; for when
women are intent upon a journey they find so
much to do and talk about that a man, no matter
how dear he may be to any member of the party,
learns to his mortification that there are times
when man is utterly uninteresting to woman.</p>

<p>Jermyn finally found himself so manifestly in
the way that he begged Trixy, whose dolls were
packed within ten minutes of the first announcement
of the impending departure, to go upon the
verandah with him and take a long look seaward.
A friend of his had been promising to sail a
yacht down from New York, and the verandah
was as good as any place in the fort from which
to view the offing. Besides, the Lieutenant did
not care to be seen again at his quarters. He
feared that a secret which several of his comrades
shared with him might not be as safe as
it should be, and he was in no humor to be
joked about the most serious interest of his life.</p>

<p>In the angle of the verandah they sat, Jermyn

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>

and Trixy, the child looking seaward through
her mother's opera-glass, and the officer looking
into the sky, his thoughts that afternoon having
a somewhat heavenly tinge.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe there's the yacht&mdash;way out
there! Don't you see it?"</p>

<p>"Where? What?" asked Jermyn, dreamily.</p>

<p>"Why, the yacht, of course. Don't you see
that great big boat with lots of sails! That's
the way yachts are, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"You don't look as I feel when folks is comin'
to see me; though, to be sure, they don't come
in yachts."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Trixy. I fear I was
thinking about something else."</p>

<p>"Say!" remarked Trixy, suddenly dropping
the glass. "Do you know what I wish? I
wish you was goin' to New York with us."</p>

<p>"Trixy," said Jermyn earnestly, "so do I."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you?"</p>

<p>"Hem! I suppose it is because I haven't
been asked."</p>

<p>"That's a funny reason! I thought big men
could do anything they wanted to, without anybody
tellin' 'em they could or they couldn't.
When I get to be a big woman, mamma says I
won't have to ask her what I can do before I do
it. Won't that be lovely?"</p>

<p>Jermyn did not reply, so the child began again
to scan the offing with the glass. Then she
wanted to do something else, and Jermyn was
reminded amusingly of some ways of his sisters,
when those estimable women were very young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say," remarked Trixy, suddenly, "mamma
says you great big soldiers are just like little
children in one way. You never can go any
place without askin' somebody to let you."</p>

<p>"Your mamma is entirely right about it," said
Jermyn, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"How funny!" said Trixy, as if talking to
herself.</p>

<p>The child finally disappeared, but Jermyn remained.
He wondered how he could explain his
reappearance at the fort, after taking a week's
leave only twenty-four hours before, should any
awkwardness on the part of any one prevent him
joining the party. He wished he might see Trif
alone for a moment or two, but he knew better
than to disturb a woman absorbed in the duties
of packing. He was uncomfortable; he felt
that he was in the way, but he pulled himself
together by saying that he might as well be a
thousand miles away from Trif and Kate as he
was at that moment, while they were occupied
as they were. He could still make a pretense of
looking for that yacht, for Trixy had left the
glasses in her chair. Perhaps, after their work
was done, one or other of the ladies might accidentally
find him, and something might be said
that would give him the opportunity for which
he longed.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Trixy, entering the room and
stumbling over trunks, "why don't Mr. Jermyn
go to New York with us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do wish he could!" exclaimed Trif.
"Fenie, wouldn't it be be delightful?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes," the girl replied, "but don't say

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>

anything about it to Kate, for the mention of it,
when it can't be done, would simply break her
heart."</p>

<p>Trixy propounded some more questions, but
was told that her mother was very busy, and
must not be bothered, so the child started in
search of other company, and when she reached
the beach she found the Admiral, whom she
asked:</p>

<p>"Who is it that officers like Mr. Jermyn have
to ask when they want to do somethin'?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Admiral, who was discussing
the naval topic of the day with a brother officer,
"why, the commandant of the fort!"</p>

<p>Trixy hung upon the Admiral's chair a moment
or two, but what she heard was as bad as
Greek to her, so she strayed away, and asked
questions of other acquaintances, and she was
gone so long that her mother wondered what had
become of her.</p>

<p>When the packing was finished, to the very
last article which had been overlooked, and for
which the trunks had to be reopened, Kate and
Fenie sat down to rest, and naturally each began
to talk of the subject which was uppermost in
the minds of both, and finally they became so
confidential that Fenie exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be lovely if Jermyn were going
North with us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Fenie!" murmured Kate, looking as
Mother Eve probably looked when the gates of
Eden closed behind her.</p>

<p>"Why don't you make him?" asked the
younger woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make him? He is an officer of the Government,
and has his duties to perform. Do you
suppose I would dare ask him to neglect them?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't see what duties there can be
to embarrass him, for there isn't any war going
on."</p>

<p>"No, but there seems to be so much else.
Don't you remember that mysterious mission
that took him and the Admiral North a few days
ago? Jermyn must be of great importance,
despite his modest rank, or he never would have
been associated with an admiral, on public
business."</p>

<p>"I'd ask him, any way, if he were my lover,
if only to make him happy for a moment," said
Fenie.</p>

<p>"Would you?" asked Kate. Should she be
outdone in affectionate impulse by a mere girl
like Fenie? She wondered what had become
of Jermyn; then she said so.</p>

<p>"He's out at the angle of this verandah, or
was a half hour ago, Trixy told me; he was
looking for the yacht of a friend. And Kate,"
continued Fenie hurriedly, for Kate had already
started, "you needn't be afraid to talk to him,
for there are no occupants of those rooms."</p>

<p>Kate tripped out to the piazza and saw Jermyn
with a face so sober that it shocked her. She
approached him softly and touched his arm; he
looked up quickly, but with an entirely different
face.</p>

<p>"Am I to go to New York all alone?" Kate
asked, with a look which set Jermyn's well-controlled
heart dancing, although its owner
said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"What? Your brother, and Mrs. Highwood
and Miss Wardlow&mdash;aren't they going?"</p>

<p>"You know very well what I mean, you consummate
hypocrite."</p>

<p>"And you know very well, or you ought to,"
said Jermyn, "that I'd gladly follow you all over
the earth. Still, I can't force myself upon the
remainder of the party."</p>

<p>"Then Trif shall invite you, at once," said
Kate.</p>

<p>"Trif," Fenie was saying at almost the same
moment, as her sister returned from an unsuccessful
search for Trixy, "Kate has gone out to
ask Jermyn to accompany us North; wouldn't
it be the graceful thing for you, as the head of
the party, to add your request to hers?"</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Trif. She was on the
piazza soon after Fenie told her where the Lieutenant
was.</p>

<p>"How kind and thoughtful of you!" said Jermyn.
"I suppose," he continued hypocritically,
"that I might possibly get permission to be
absent a few days longer if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," intruded the voice of
Trixy. "You can go, and that ain't all&mdash;you'll
get into a lot of trouble if you don't go. I've
been to see the head man about it."</p>

<p>"The head man?" echoed Jermyn, while the
others looked inquiringly at the child.</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you know? I mean the man
up at the fort, that all you soldiers have to ask
when you want to do anything. I told him all
about it, although he kept on interruptin', and
sayin' 'yes, yes,' as if he wanted me to stop

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>

talkin'. I didn't stop, though, so at last he said,
'Little girl, I've already heard something about
the matter. Please say to Lieutenant Jermyn,
with my compliments, that he is to go to New
York at once, and that he isn't to show his face
here again for several days, and that if he dares
to do so I may have him held to account for
getting a leave of absence on false pretenses.'
There!&mdash;I think I've told it just like he said it, so
you see you'll have to go if you don't want to
catch it."</p>

<p>"Trixy," exclaimed Jermyn, utterly aghast,
"do you mean to say that you have actually
called upon the Post Commandant and told him
that I was here, and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told him everything I could, so he'd
be sure to let you go; told him about your bein'
here to lunch with mamma&mdash;he looked awful
s'prised then, 'cause he thought you'd gone to
New York, so I told him what you went for, and
how the Admiral brought you back, and then he
told me he wished I'd find the Admiral and say
he'd be glad to have him come up to the fort to
dinner. Then he looked as if he didn't know
what to think, and I got afraid that mebbe he'd
change his mind and not let you go after all, so
I told him that 'twas real important, and about
last night up by the lighthouse&mdash;don't you remember?
Oh, mamma! I promised you real
solemn that I wouldn't say a word about that to
anybody, didn't I! I wonder how I came to do
it?"</p>

<p>Kate looked at Jermyn, and Jermyn blushed;
then he looked at Kate, and Kate blushed; as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>

to the others, they looked at both of them and
laughed merrily. But Kate wasn't going to let
the dear fellow feel uncomfortable, so she said
softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll go with us?"</p>

<p>"You've heard my orders, my dear, although
I must say that they did not come through the
customary official channels, but as I got a week's
leave last night for this very purpose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall have a blissful week," interrupted
Trif, "with no one to disturb or make trouble."</p>

<p>"But you forget that the General commanding
this department has headquarters at New
York, and if Trixy should&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h&mdash;" whispered Kate. "That dreadful
child might appeal to the President of the
United States, in his capacity as commander-in-chief
of the army and navy."</p>

<p>"Do be quiet," said Jermyn. "The child is
listening with all her might."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<span class="small">APRIL SHOWERS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">A HAPPIER couple than Fenie and Harry
could not be found in all New York. This
must be true, for both of them said so one evening
while they were the only occupants of Trif's
cozy parlor, while Trif and her husband were
out, making a short call.</p>

<p>Harry had just told Fenie that while he was
very happy about his sister and Jermyn, because
he thought them specially suited to each other,
he was also very sorry for them, for naturally
love could not be so delightful to Jermyn as to
him, for was not the officer at least ten years the
older. Ten years, to Harry, seemed time enough
to transform a young man into a person of middle
age.</p>

<p>Fenie said she never would have mentioned
such things if Harry had not begun it, but she
was dreadfully sorry for Kate, for the dear girl,
being much older than she&mdash;six or seven years
older&mdash;could not know the bliss of youth that
gives itself entirely to thoughts of love.</p>

<p>Harry did not like to hear any allusions made
to the age of his sister, for Kate had always
seemed to him, until he met Fenie, the embodiment
of everything girlishly delightful. Was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>

she not the merriest romp of the family? Was
it not she who always brought him out of his
brown studies? Did she not play with the
younger children as if she herself was still in
short dresses?</p>

<p>By a natural coincidence, Jermyn and Kate,
only a few squares away, were congratulating
themselves that they were not young things like
Harry and Fenie. They had seen much of the
world; they knew men and women well; they
had gone through many illusions from start to
finish, but now they had found each other, the
world might move on in its orbit, or out of its
orbit, with no end of trouble to all concerned&mdash;except
them. They were one in soul and purpose
for all time, and, they devoutly hoped, for
all eternity.</p>

<p>About this time a bell rang somewhere in the
house, but neither of them heeded it. Why should
they? Were they not sitting and looking as if Jermyn
had merely dropped in for an evening call?
Kate was pretending to do some alleged "fancy
work," and Jermyn was admiring the movements
of her pretty hands, and wishing that his pay or
his prospects were so good that the aforesaid
pretty hands might never have to do anything
more exacting or less becoming, and thinking he
had been a brute to propose to such a woman
when he had only his pay, nearly two thousand
a year, and a thousand or two dollars he had
saved, when the current of his thoughts was disturbed
by the appearance of Trixy, who stood
before him in a waterproof cloak and a face
covered with tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trixy!" exclaimed Jermyn. "What has
happened to you?"</p>

<p>"They're havin' an awful row," sobbed the
child.</p>

<p>"They? Not your father and mother?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! They never fight&mdash;aren't you
ashamed of yourself! It's the other two&mdash;Aunt
Fee and Harry. She says she never loved him
much anyhow, and she didn't ask him to go
down South and bother her, and he said he
didn't believe she knew her own mind, and she
said she wished he had any mind worth knowin',
and she wished he was half as much of a man
as Lieutenant Jermyn, that he'd been abusin'.
She said you was a man, and he wasn't
nothin' but a boy. And papa and mamma was
gone out, and I was awful frightened, and I got
the cook to bring me around here, so I could
ask Miss Trewman if somethin' couldn't be done
for 'em."</p>

<p>"Why should he have abused me?" asked
Jermyn of no one in particular.</p>

<p>"Why should she compare him with you?"
asked Kate. "Jermyn," she exclaimed, "did
you ever make love to Fenie Wardlow?"</p>

<p>"Never! Upon my honor, my dear."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sure I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither do I. Suppose I go around with
Trixy and find out?"</p>

<p>"I shall go with you," said Kate. There was
something in her voice that Jermyn had never
heard before, and it distracted his thoughts
about Harry and Fenie. Nevertheless the two
quickly left the house together, and Jermyn

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>

talked to Trixy rather than to Kate, and Kate
was made so uncomfortable thereby that she
talked incessantly to Trixy, which mystified Jermyn
greatly, although Kate's hand grasped his
arm tightly all the while.</p>

<p>On their way they chanced to meet Harry, to
whom Jermyn said quickly:</p>

<p>"Well met, old chap! Come along with us.
We are going to make a call and would like to
have you with us; we can promise that you shall
have a pleasant time."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad if something pleasant would happen
on this particular evening&mdash;confound it!"
replied Harry in the gruff tone which some very
young men, despite good breeding and association,
sometimes indulge in. When they reached
the Highwoods' house and started up the steps
Harry shrank backward and said:</p>

<p>"Not there, thank you. Not this evening."</p>

<p>He started quickly away, but Jermyn, with
Kate still clinging to his arm, soon overtook
him, grasped his shoulder as a policeman might
seize a prisoner, and said, kindly enough:</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I've seen a score of clever
youngsters through lovers' quarrels, and I'm going
to see you through one this evening&mdash;now,
or I'm going to break your neck. Which do
you prefer?"</p>

<p>Harry answered nothing, although he acted
like a surly criminal led by a jailor. Meanwhile
Kate was grasping Jermyn's arm tightly and
pressing close to his side. What had become of
Trixy no one knew or thought, yet no sooner
did they ring the bell than the child stood in
the open doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate hurried to Fenie's room, where she found
the occupant bathed in tears. At any other time
such a spectacle would have moved Kate to tenderness,
but now she rudely shook the girl and
asked:</p>

<p>"Tryphena Wardlow, were you ever in love
with Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the girl with a wondering blush.
"That is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he ever make love to you? Tell me&mdash;this
instant!"</p>

<p>"No. That is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he ever kiss you?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no&mdash;a thousand times no! Aren't
you ashamed of yourself, to have asked such a
question?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am!" said Kate, "and I sincerely
beg your pardon, but&mdash;here, dear, let me dry
your eyes. You poor little darling, has Harry
been a brute? Oh, won't I make life miserable
for him when I get him alone, at home? There,
dear! If your own sister isn't here to comfort
you, you shan't lack another. Come down stairs
with me; Jermyn is here, and I want you to look
your prettiest."</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary," said Fenie, trying to
clear her face of the traces of sorrow and anger.
"He's no eyes for any one else when you're
present."</p>

<p>"You darling girl! Say that again&mdash;and
again!"</p>

<p>"Old chap," Jermyn was saying to Harry,
"I don't know what has been the trouble, but I
know the nature of it, for I've seen signs of it in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>

many other men who have been in love. Take
all the blame to yourself&mdash;do! 'Tis the privilege
of men to relieve women of all of that sort of
thing they can."</p>

<p>"'Tis very well for you to talk," grumbled
Harry. "'They jest at scars that never felt a
wound.' But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, you blessed idiot, do you know what
you are in danger of losing? Fenie is one of
the sweetest little women on the face of the
earth."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Harry defiantly.
"Were you ever in love with her? From something
she said this evening I am half inclined
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was in love with her sister, many years
ago," said Jermyn softly; "so I know the family
quality."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Harry, humbly,
and trying hard to be once more a gentleman.
"But she said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis no matter what she said. Be a man;
be a lover; be a gentleman. Sh&mdash;h&mdash;h-!&mdash;they're
coming."</p>

<p>Kate entered with Fenie, who greeted Jermyn
effusively, while Harry chatted with his sister,
there being no one else for him to speak to, for
Trixy had disappeared. Kate and Jermyn soon
succeeded in making the conversation general,
and in compelling Harry and Fenie to talk to
each other. Then Jermyn and Kate began to
admire some of the Highwoods' pictures so intently
that Harry and Fenie could talk only to
each other; they dropped their voices, but the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>

tones were audible and promised well. Finally,
as the others turned they saw something which
caused them to say:</p>

<p>"We beg a thousand pardons."</p>

<p>"You needn't," replied Fenie bravely. "We've
made up, and I don't care if all the world knows
it, for it was all my fault from the first."</p>

<p>"What a fib!" exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>"It isn't! But how&mdash;" here Fenie turned
to Kate, "did you chance to come to the rescue?
My heart was almost broken."</p>

<p>"And mine," added Harry.</p>

<p>"And mine," said Kate tragically.</p>

<p>"Mine is of no particular consequence,"
drawled Jermyn, with a reproachful look at
Kate, "still, it got a frightful stab."</p>

<p>"You poor fallow!" exclaimed Kate, making
amends in the most delightful manner appropriate
to the occasion. This demonstration incited
Harry and Fenie to be very tender to each
other, and there was an instant of delicious
silence, too soon broken by a pitiful wail which
seemed to come from a portière.</p>

<p>"I s'pose it don't matter about my poor little
bit of a heart, but it was broke most to pieces."</p>

<p>"Did that child overhear the quarrel?" whispered
Fenie.</p>

<p>"'Twas she who brought us word about it,"
Kate replied.</p>

<p>Then Harry and Fenie kissed Trixy, and Jermyn
took her into his arms, and the child,
relieved of her load of responsibility, fell asleep,
and Jermyn held her so tenderly and looked at
her so fondly and thoughtfully that Kate looked

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>

upon him with a new and tender expression in
her eyes, although she wouldn't for the world
have had him see it. Finally Kate herself took
the child, so softly that she did not waken it,
and carried it to and fro a moment or two, and
finally laid it upon a sofa, and Jermyn looked at
Kate every moment, and thought, and thought,
and thought. At last he ventured to remark:</p>

<p>"All the artists and poets have been wrong.
They should have made Cupid a little girl."</p>

<p>The four sat and talked until Trif and Phil
returned, and then they continued to talk, yet
the astute heads of the family did not hear or
see anything that could make them imagine that
there had been any trouble. Indeed, Trif told
her husband that it seemed strange that Jermyn
and Kate should have spared time for a call on
that particular evening, when Jermyn's time was
so short, and he must soon be away for no one
knew how long.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<span class="small">"THEY TAKE NO NOTE OF TIME."</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">KATE and Jermyn were so happy in each
other's society, now that they had not to
pay attention to a lot of mere acquaintances,
that they agreed with the hero of Gilbert and
Sullivan's "Mikado" that each second was a
minute, each minute an hour, each hour a day,
and each day a year. Nevertheless, after the
illogical manner of lovers, no sooner was the
last half of the week under way than they began
to complain that each day seemed only an
hour long.</p>

<p>"Must you really go at the end of your
week?" asked Kate. "Does a week, in military
parlance, mean literally a week&mdash;no more, no
less?"</p>

<p>"Exactly and mathematically a week," sighed
Jermyn. "Tis even worse in our case, for the
week includes the time I spent in reaching here,
the time I will spend in returning, and the day I
started, but was taken back by the Admiral."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Kate, after a startled look,
"that means that you must start back to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"It does indeed. I've gone over it by every
applicable rule of arithmetic, but I can find no
other solution."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate at once became so dismal that she could
not talk much, and Jermyn, remembering the
ways of his mother and sisters when they had
trouble on their minds, suggested that there
could be no better time to make his good-bye
call upon the Highwoods; he assured himself
that a short chat with sympathetic women would
enable Kate to bear her trouble more bravely.
He got his reward, for Trif chatted so kindly
with him that he himself soon felt much better
than he had dared hope, so he felt correspondingly
grateful, and wished he might do something
in return for the good woman to whose interest
he owed so much of his fortune in love.
Suddenly there came to him a thought which
he voiced at once.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Highwood, I shall go back by way
of Washington. I'm greatly your debtor; I
needn't go into particulars, but wouldn't you
like to spend a few hours in Washington? You
couldn't have a better guide than I, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twould be splendid!" Trif exclaimed. "But
you wouldn't be so heartless as to leave Kate
behind?"</p>

<p>"I'm greatly obliged for the suggestion."</p>

<p>"And," continued Trif, who had been thinking
rapidly, "would it be dreadful of me to take
Trixy also? She has long been wild to see the
'Baby of the White House,' and by some lucky
accident she might get a peep at that fortunate
child."</p>

<p>"It might not be difficult; I've had the honor
of meeting the baby's mother, in other years,
and am sure she would be delighted to meet a
woman like Trixy's mother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will go," said Trif. "I shan't have to
wait to consult Phil, for he asked me why I
didn't improve my opportunity to see Washington
during our return trip from Old Point."</p>

<p>A cheerful party of four started for Washington
the next afternoon, and on the morning afterward
Jermyn busied himself in showing the ladies
the sights of the capital. But Washington is a
large city, and time did fly so rapidly&mdash;to Kate
and Jermyn, for the latter would be obliged to
take the night train for Fort Monroe.</p>

<p>Trixy saw the baby of the White House, and
devoured it with her eyes, and asked it questions
about its dolls, while two fond mothers looked
and listened. The call was short, but, as the
party made their adieus, Trixy slipped back and
said to the lady of the house:</p>

<p>"Your husband can do anything he likes with
soldiers, can't he?"</p>

<p>"That depends," was the reply. "Why do
you ask?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I wish he would make Lieutenant
Jermyn go back to New York with us. I'm sure
Miss Trewman wishes so too, 'cause they're only
just engaged, and he's only been in New York
a week, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There goes the only man who could manage
an affair of that kind," said the lady, pointing to
an alert-looking gentleman who was approaching
the house.</p>

<p>"Thank you, very much."</p>

<p>"Where is Trixy?" asked Trif, as the party
passed through the gateway. "Why, there she
is, talking to a stranger! How the child has

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>

lost her manners! Mr. Jermyn, won't you kindly
bring her back?"</p>

<p>Jermyn hurried to the rescue, and was somewhat
astonished to see that the gentleman with
whom Trixy was talking was the Secretary of
War.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jermyn!" said the Secretary. Jermyn
saluted.</p>

<p>"This young lady has been telling me an interesting
story. By the way, there are to be
some new guns tested at Sandy Hook, New York
harbor, in a day or two. It might be of use to
some of the classes at the fort if an officer from
there were to observe the tests and take back a
detailed report. Would your own studies be retarded
if you were to remain absent a week or
ten days longer?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Jermyn replied, with the
promptness becoming a soldier.</p>

<p>"Call at the Department some time this afternoon,
then, for your detail. I'll send a copy of
it to your commanding officer, and you will report
by letter to him, so that you may be recalled
if necessary. Will you do me the honor to introduce
me to this young lady?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure. Miss Highwood, allow me
to present the Honorable the Secretary of War."</p>

<p>"What a long name!" exclaimed Trixy, with
a curtesy.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Miss Highwood, that my time
won't allow me to show you special attention
while you are here, but I hope we may meet
again. Good day. Mr. Jermyn, I wish you a
pleasant trip!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Jermyn hurried the child back to her mother,
who said:</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Jermyn, that you apologized to
the gentleman for Trixy's rudeness?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't the opportunity," Jermyn replied.
"Ladies, I've an interesting announcement to
make; I am to accompany you back to New
York."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jermyn!" exclaimed Kate. "'Tis too
good to be true."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, 'tis as true as it is good. The
gentleman with whom Trixy was talking was
the Secretary of War, and he has ordered me
back, for a few days, on duty that will occupy
my time for only a few hours a day."</p>

<p>"You clever fellow! How did you manage
it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. Trixy did it."</p>

<p>"Trixy!" echoed both ladies.</p>

<p>"Why," said the child, "I only told him all
about Mr. Jermyn and Miss Trewman. The
lady in the White House told me he was the
right man to ask if Mr. Jermyn couldn't go back
to New York with us, so I asked him." Then
Trixy looked up with the inquiring air she always
had when she suspected she had done
something wrong, but didn't know what it was.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" exclaimed Kate. "I wonder
only that she didn't ask the President himself."</p>

<p>"That's what I was goin' to do," explained
Trixy, "but the lady said the other man was the
right one, so I asked him."</p>

<p>All three adults stopped and stared fixedly at
Trixy, at which the child began to cry; so Trif

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>

picked her up and kissed her and told her to
"never mind," and Kate stooped and kissed
her, and when she lifted her head there were
tears in her eyes; so Trif looked hurriedly toward
the War Department and said it was good
for the public sense of propriety and dignity that
the Secretary was out of sight, otherwise it
would be just like Kate to kiss him also, as she
had kissed the Admiral on a certain occasion.</p>

<p>Kate hurried the party away; she explained
later that while looking toward the White House
she was sure that she saw the hostess looking
through the window at her and smiling at her.</p>

<p>"I declare!" she said, with downcast eyes
and cheeks a-flame, "there's no living with
Trixy, nor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor any living without her&mdash;eh?" added
Jermyn.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was the very merriest,
so four people said, that any party had
ever spent in Washington. Jermyn took his
guests to the old chamber of the House of Representatives,
and mystified them a few moments
with the "whispering gallery" over the Speaker's
desk, making Kate his latest victim, despite
her appeals to him to be quiet, and his assurances
that no one else could hear a word he
was saying, although he was forty feet away.
Kate became so embarrassed that she suddenly
withdrew and Trixy took her place&mdash;a change
which Jermyn did not notice until he heard a
peal of childish laughter, and, stepping forward,
saw Kate and Trif standing some steps from
the arch and Trixy joining them, and saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the funniest thing I ever heard of!"</p>

<p>"What is the funniest thing, dear?" asked
Trif.</p>

<p>"Trixy," exclaimed Jermyn, "don't tell,
please."</p>

<p>"But I must mind mamma," pleaded the
child. "Besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trixy," exclaimed Jermyn, "if you repeat
what I said I'll never speak to you again."</p>

<p>"Trixy," said Kate, "if you don't tell I'll
never speak to you again&mdash;I mean," for Kate
had caught an appealing look from Jermyn&mdash;"I
won't speak to you if you do tell."</p>

<p>The child was so confused that she did not
know what to do, so she turned to her mother
for advice, and Trif hurried her a few steps in
advance.</p>

<p>"Remember, Trixy!" cried Kate after them.</p>

<p>"Don't forget, Trixy!" shouted Jermyn, in his
sternest tone of command.</p>

<p>Two more uncomfortable lovers than Kate
and Jermyn were in the next five minutes could
not have been found anywhere, for Kate wondered
what it was all about and insisted upon
knowing, and Jermyn replied that he would tell
her at some future time, and Kate wanted to
know why he couldn't tell her at once, and Jermyn
replied, somewhat sheepishly, that some
things might be said in the privacy of a whispering
gallery that could not easily be said face to
face in a crowded street, upon which Kate
wailed:</p>

<p>"But that child heard it!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear; she'll forget it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not she! I'm beginning to believe that the
smaller the child the less chance there is of her
forgetting what shouldn't be remembered. And,
oh, Jermyn! Of all men in the world, here
comes Admiral Allison! What if she should
tell him?"</p>

<p>"If she does," said Jermyn desperately, "I'll
never again dare look him in the face; I shall
always believe he is laughing at me. 'Tis all
your fault, my dear. If you hadn't made me
love you so dearly, I wouldn't have said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us overtake them&mdash;quick!" said Kate.</p>

<p>"We've been up to the whisp'rin' gall'ry,"
Trixy was already saying to the Admiral,
"and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trixy!" sternly spoke three voices as one.</p>

<p>"What rare fortunes Providence has in store
for old men!" exclaimed the Admiral. "I
greatly wanted and needed to see Jermyn, this
very day, and I not only find him unexpectedly,
but get a couple of glimpses of Paradise beside&mdash;yes,
three, for here is Trixy also."</p>

<p>"Paradise?" echoed Trixy. "It was somethin'
about Paradise that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trixy!" said Jermyn warningly.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said the Admiral, "to take you
all to a hotel, where I may rob you of Jermyn a
few moments."</p>

<p>Jermyn took the child's hand, placed himself
between her and the Admiral, and thus they
walked to the hotel.</p>

<span class="small">"BEYOND THE DREAM OF AVARICE."</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">"MY dear boy," said the Admiral, as soon
as the party had been comfortably
stowed at a hotel, of which officers of the united
service are very fond, and after luncheon had
been ordered, "don't you want to make your fortune
by a few strokes of your pen&mdash;or pencil?"</p>

<p>"Admiral," replied Jermyn, "my heart never
before warned me so savagely of the condition
of my pocket. Fire away."</p>

<p>"Good! Do you remember a conversation we
had a few nights ago at the fort with a certain
semi-public character about business?"</p>

<p>"A few nights ago?" repeated Jermyn dreamily.
"I remember such a talk, but it seems that
it was a few months ago."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! Wake up! This is business&mdash;not
moonshine."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Jermyn, quietly
rallying himself. "You mean the affair of that
gold placer on the Pacific Coast? Do you suppose
I ever can forget it, after the misery that
came of it, and the trouble you were put to?"</p>

<p>"Never mind me, at present, except to give
me your close attention. My dear boy, our
suggestions did the business, and Blogsham has

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>

more sense of honor than I usually attribute to a
business man. Our plans were of so much promise
that he has already organized a company to
develop the property. The capital is a million
dollars, with permission to increase to three millions,
and there are at present ten thousand shares
of the par value of one hundred dollars each."</p>

<p>"Hem! That sounds business-like, but I don't
see how it implies the sense of honor of which
you spoke a moment ago."</p>

<p>"What? Oh, to be sure; I've not reached
the most important part of the story. Well, the
projector writes me that he hasn't forgotten his
promise, and that there are five hundred shares
of the stock waiting for me, and five hundred for
you, which we can have if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I've fooled away enough of my hard
earnings upon projects of that kind. Excitement
of that sort may do for you, on the pay of a rear
admiral, retired, but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do let me finish, won't you? I wouldn't put
a cent into gold-mining, unless I myself were the
manager of the concern, if I were a dozen times
as well off as I am. But don't you remember
Blogsham's promise? We're to have this stock
for nothing but the services we have already
rendered. Blogsham asks only that the transactions
and his assertions to the company may
be entirely business-like, that we shall send him
for the company's archives, the sketches which
gave him his new ideas as to how to make the
placer a working success."</p>

<p>"Whew-w-w-w-!" whistled Jermyn. "Will
you kindly remember where those sketches are

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>

&mdash;or where there is every reason to believe they
are?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; nevertheless they must be obtained.
Fifty thousand dollars is too much
money for either of us to throw away&mdash;Blogsham
says the stock can already be sold at par.
I'm sure that Mrs. Highwood is too much interested
in your future welfare to make any objection
to giving up the original document."</p>

<p>"You forget that she sent it to her husband."</p>

<p>"Well, he and she are one, aren't they? I
should imagine so, from Madam Trif's manner
of talking about her lord and master."</p>

<p>"But there was a private letter on the same
sheet of paper, which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which can easily be erased."</p>

<p>"I can't ask it&mdash;really I can't," said Jermyn.
"I'd rather lose fifty thousand dollars than remind
Mrs. Highwood of something that would
be embarrassing to think of, in my presence."</p>

<p>"Then ask her by letter, from as far away as
you like. It ought to be done at once though,
for offers like Blogsham's are too much in air
when made only verbally. We must have the
sketches. If you won't ask for them I must.
My conscience won't let me see a woman like
Miss Trewman marry a subaltern with less than
two thousand a year. The income of fifty thousand
dollars, added to your own salary, will enable
you to marry, and support your wife in a
manner that she is accustomed to."</p>

<p>Jermyn was in an unpleasant quandary, but
he soon got out of it by saying that to ask for
the letter would be ungentlemanly of him, so he
couldn't do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, you stupid fellow," said the Admiral,
"I myself shall ask for them&mdash;for my own
sketch, at least. She already knows that I
know the contents of the letter."</p>

<p>"You won't dare remind her of it," exclaimed
Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Won't I, though! Indeed I will. I have
sufficient excuse. I shall tell her frankly why I
want it&mdash;that an estimable though obstinate
friend of mine is about to marry on an insufficient
income, and that I'm so sorry for his wife
that I'm going to settle fifty thousand dollars
upon her, and that I can't do it unless I regain
the sketch which was on the blank half of that
letter sheet; your sketch, you'll remember, was
on the back of the written portion. Then, if
she gives me the entire letter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which you know she wouldn't do."</p>

<p>"I don't see why not, if I first ask her to
erase the writing. Now, my dear boy, I have
you at my mercy. You're on your way back to
the fort; I will accompany the ladies back to
New York, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha! You will, will you?" exclaimed the
younger man, with a soldier's instinctive delight
at getting an enemy at a disadvantage. "I'm going
back to New York with them myself. I've
been ordered back, on duty."</p>

<p>"Hem! For how long, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, as you can learn by inquiry at the Department,
I may as well tell you that it will be
for a week, at the least."</p>

<p>"Suppose, then," said the Admiral, after a
moment of thought, "that we agree upon an

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>

armistice. You go to New York; so shall I. I
shan't annoy you in your special business&mdash;never
fear&mdash;and I'll give you a full week in which to
make up your mind, but if by that time you
haven't procured those sketches I shall charge
myself with the getting of them, no matter how
much begging and arguing may be required.
Is it agreed?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be," said Jermyn. "You
well know that I couldn't willingly deprive you
of the chance to make fifty thousand dollars,
after all you have done for me, you great-hearted
old rascal!"</p>

<p>"Not even if I were to give the money to your
wife?" said the Admiral, with a world of shrewdness
in the sidelong look with which he regarded
his companion.</p>

<p>"You know very well that I wouldn't allow
you to do such a thing!" replied Jermyn angrily.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the Admiral.</p>

<p>By that time the luncheon was ready, and the
Admiral made himself delightfully companionable
to the ladies, but Jermyn was so silent and
abstracted that even Kate rallied him, asking
him if the New York duties which the War Department
had imposed, compelled such hard
thinking? Jermyn replied that they weren't,
but that the Admiral had just given him the most
provoking lot of orders that one man ever received
from another, so both ladies insisted at
once upon knowing what the orders were, and
both men maintained silence to a degree that
was simply maddening, so Kate quizzed Jermyn
privately, and he told her, privately, that she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>

mustn't say another word about it. Kate afterward
told Trif, in confidence, that she must have
been right in supposing that the business upon
which the two men had gone North, a few days
before, must have been of great importance to
the Government, as well as of an extremely secret
nature; but that, nevertheless, it was a burning
shame that older officers had such despotic control
of their juniors, and that if women had charge
of government affairs, there would not be any of
such manifest injustice.</p>

<p>They all went to New York that night. While
Jermyn visited the Department for his order, the
Admiral scoured Washington for the projector
of the gold mine, who had been in the city the
day before, but as the man had already returned
to the metropolis, the Admiral intended to be at
his elbow, to keep the promise of stock alive until
the sketches could be obtained. Should there
seem to be any danger, he would promptly break
the armistice and ask Trif for the fateful letter.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, while the two officers were
smoking together on the train, Jermyn struck
terror to the Admiral's heart by saying:</p>

<p>"Your plan for reclaiming those pictures may
be of no good. 'Tis more than likely that Highwood
has destroyed that letter."</p>

<p>"My dear boy!" exclaimed the old man.
"Please don't imagine anything so dreadful!
Destroyed one hundred thousand dollars? Horrors!"</p>

<p>"I think it likely," continued Jermyn, "for at
Old Point I chanced to hear Mrs. Highwood
say that after carefully reading her husband's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>

letters she always destroyed them, so that no
one else by any chance could see them. Like
husband, like wife&mdash;you know the old saying."</p>

<p>"But you saw the letter in Highwood's own
hands," said the Admiral.</p>

<p>"True; but at that time his wife was away,
and I suppose he kept all of her letters to look
at again and again&mdash;I am sure I should do so,
if I were married and my wife was away from
me."</p>

<p>"Good boy! I'm glad to see that you already
know the feeling. Still&mdash;if he should have destroyed
them!"</p>

<p>It was the Admiral's turn to be strangely silent
during the evening, and the ladies marvelled
greatly at the change in a man who had seemed
to them the life of whatever company he chanced
to be in, and Kate found opportunity to whisper
to Trif that Jermyn did not seem to be entirely
under the Admiral's thumb after all, for he
seemed to be in remarkably good spirits&mdash;commanding
spirits, indeed, she could say.</p>

<p>At a part of the road over which the train
passed early in the night, Jermyn begged the
ladies to go with him to the rear platform to
observe a beautiful moonlight landscape which
he knew of old. The Admiral, who remained
behind with Trixy, soon began to sketch on the
back of a letter. The shrewd old chap had
argued to himself that if the letter had really
been destroyed there could be nothing dishonorable
in duplicating his own sketch on the
back of another letter, and offering it in evidence.
It would be virtually the same picture,
for he would draw it from memory, as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>He worked so long that Trixy, wishing to do
something new, began to look over his shoulder,
and soon she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why-y-y! I've got a picture just like
that."</p>

<p>"You have?" replied the Admiral, carelessly.
"That's strange; where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I tore it off a letter&mdash;the back of that letter
that came from the fort one day, for you, don't
you know, and I opened it by mistake while I
was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Admiral dropped pencil and paper,
placed his hands upon Trixy's shoulders, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You have that picture? Where?"</p>

<p>"Why, in my scrap-book, at home."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand dollars saved!" shouted the
Admiral. He was anything but silent when the
ladies returned; indeed, he talked so incessantly
that Trif had to break in upon one of his best
stories by pleading that she must remove some
of the dust of travel before leaving the train at
New York.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br />
<span class="small">TRICKS UPON TRIXY.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">AFTER reaching New York the Admiral lost
no time in calling at the Highwoods, and
although he tried to appear at his best, Fenie
said to her sister in strict confidence that there
must be something about sea air which specially
suited veteran sailors, for the Admiral did not
seem the same man he had been at Old Point.
He was genial, courteous, conversational, witty,
but there was a certain indefinable something
lacking; after much study, the girl concluded
that the difference came of a strange absent-minded
manner which appeared to possess him
once in a while, for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>As the old gentleman had spent but a single
hour at the Highwoods when this sage conclusion
was announced, Trif called her sister a
goose, and said she had been carrying Harry in
her mind so long that she was incapable of judging
other men with any degree of fairness.
Nevertheless, Trif told her husband that the
Admiral did not seem entirely himself.</p>

<p>The truth was that the old gentleman chanced
to call at an hour when Trixy was calling upon
a juvenile acquaintance a few squares away,
and as she was at the age when children never

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>

know when to go home unless they are sent
away or sent for, the Admiral was unable to accomplish
the real purpose of his visit, which
was to see Trixy's scrap-book. He went away
with about as uncomfortable a mind as you or I
might have, dear reader, were fifty thousand
dollars almost within our grasp, yet with a
child's caprice and carelessness somewhere between
it and full possession.</p>

<p>The Admiral rested badly that night, but he
awoke in the morning with a capital plan of
operations. He went to a bookstore and purchased
a large assortment of illustrated papers,
American and foreign, and sent them to his hotel.
Then he made a morning call at the Highwoods,
just for a moment, to ask if he might not
take Trixy to walk with him. The child was
delighted, especially when the old gentleman
took her to his hotel and showed her all his
picture papers, and asked her whether she
would not like to spend the following morning
with him, and bring her scrap-book, so that he
and she might paste into it all the pictures she
might select from his papers.</p>

<p>Success being thus assured, his spirits returned
in full force, so that after he called on
Kate Trewman in the afternoon Kate herself
hurried around to the Highwoods to tell them
that she had never before found the Admiral
such delightful company, and that evidently
there was nothing like a trip to New York to
brighten any one's wits. Trif and Fenie were
mystified, and after Kate's departure they agreed
that there must be something in advancing years
that made men variable in spite of themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The Admiral lay in wait for Jermyn, who was
to dine with him that evening after returning
from the gun-proving grounds, and he tormented
the young man so unmercifully about the letter
that Jermyn wished he had dined alone. The
Admiral could afford to be playful, for was he
not sure of getting at least one of the pictures?</p>

<p>The next morning bright and early he called
for Trixy and her scrap-book, and gallantly insisted
upon relieving her of the weight of the
book itself; with the precious volume in his
hand he felt as if the stock certificates were
already in his possession. He hurried the child
to his hotel, heartlessly passing several candy
shops and two soda-water places, until some
pointed remarks brought him to a proper sense
of the courtesies due to very young ladies who
walk with gentlemen of mature years.</p>

<p>Trixy's tongue, never inactive for many moments
at a time, was entirely loosened by the
gratifying flavors imparted to it by the Admiral's
kindness, so its owner soon began to talk of the
two subjects which were uppermost in home
conversation.</p>

<p>"Say," she asked, "Mr. Jermyn don't have
to be killed until there is a war, does he?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, my dear, nor even if there should
be a war. What put so dreadful an idea into
your head?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only that mamma says it would be so
dreadful when Miss Trewman loves him so
much. Besides, mamma says it would be dreadful
hard in another way, 'cause the Trewmans
ain't rich. They used to be, but their father

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>

lost a lot of money in business a few years ago,
and papa says he hasn't got it back yet."</p>

<p>The Admiral quickly lost his compunctions of
conscience about the trick he intended to play,
which was to abstract the original sketch from
Trixy's scrap-book during the clipping and
pasting operations at the hotel, and substitute
the imitation which he had made on the train.
It had seemed an ungentlemanly and under-handed
thing to do, much though he informed
himself that the result would not injure the
child in any way. Now, after what Trixy had
told him about the condition of the Trewman
finances, it would be a matter of absolute duty.
Still more, he would fulfil the threat he had
made to Jermyn, in case Jermyn's own sketch
could not be recovered. He could not do it all
at once, of course; Jermyn's pride would never
allow it, but he would make the bride a handsome
present in government bonds on her wedding
day, and he would bequeath the remainder
of the fifty thousand to her in his will, and
should the fortunes of war or peace take Jermyn
from earth before him, he would see that the
remainder of the money should reach the widow
at once. With such virtuous and unselfish resolves,
what harm could there be in plundering
a small girl's scrap-book?</p>

<p>"Papa says," continued Trixy, "that there is
no sense in worryin' about it, 'cause both of 'em
are so fond of each other that they'd marry for
love even if they had to starve afterward."</p>

<p>"Hem! Quite likely. I suspect I would, if I
were either of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that so? I must tell mamma that, 'cause
p'raps it will keep her from worryin'. Papa
says she worries too much about her friends'
affairs."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;my dear, I wouldn't say anything about
it, if I were you; for maybe your parents might
not like to think that you had been repeating
any of their conversation."</p>

<p>It took considerable effort on the part of the
Admiral to prevent any farther disclosures, and
the old gentleman was very glad when he reached
the hotel, and an examination of the pictorial
papers gave the child something new to talk
about. The Admiral had scissors and paste
ready, and allowed Trixy to clip at will while he
endeavored to rob the scrap-book. He lost no
time in turning the pages, but a hasty examination
failed to disclose the sketch which represented
fifty thousand dollars, so he looked
again, with extreme care. Toward the end his
heart sank, and at the last page he uttered a low
groan.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Trixy, looking
up from her work.</p>

<p>"I beg a thousand pardons, my dear. I
merely gave way, for an instant, to a bad habit
into which old gentlemen sometimes fall. How
are you getting along? Oh, you're finding a
capital lot, aren't you? Don't you want to stop
a moment or two, and show me your book?"</p>

<p>Trixy began at once to turn the leaves, and to
tell the story of each picture. The Admiral
listened patiently as long as he could, but soon
he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't you show me the one that is like the
sketch I made on the train the day we returned
from Washington?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." Trixy turned the pages rapidly,
but suddenly stopped and looked puzzled; then
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Somebody's hooked it, I do believe!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" said the Admiral, in a
shaky voice. "Look again; perhaps you have
pasted some other picture over it."</p>

<p>"No I didn't. I know just where I had it in
the book; it was right here, by the picture
Aunt Fee made of some of the sand hills behind
the fort, because they were the only two drawin's
I had. And now there ain't nothin there!"</p>

<p>The Admiral looked carefully at the page.
Evidently something had been pasted there, and
with childish lavishness of mucilage. It could
not have dropped out, for bits of paper still
adhered to the page. It was plain that some one
had carefully removed the sketch.</p>

<p>"Trixy," said the Admiral, as a suspicion
came into his mind, "have you ever shown this
book to Lieutenant Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"No, never. He ain't ever at our house long
enough for me to show him anything."</p>

<p>"Have you loaned the book to any other little
girl, or exchanged pictures with any one?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Besides, I was keepin' that
picture real careful, to remind me of somethin'&mdash;mamma
told me to. She told me that whenever
I looked at that picture I must remember to
never again take any writin' from her portfolio
and ask other people to finish it for me. I'd

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>

just like to know what's happened to that picture;
I'm goin' to ask ev'rybody about it as
soon as I get back home."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, please," said the Admiral hastily,
"or you'll make me very unhappy."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should dislike to have your father and
mother and aunt annoyed about so slight a
matter&mdash;so far as I am concerned; and you
wouldn't have thought of it, you know, if I
hadn't spoken of it."</p>

<p>"But they wouldn't be annoyed, and p'raps
one of 'em knows where the picture is."</p>

<p>"Eh? Which of them?" The old gentleman
looked keenly over the tops of his glasses
as a new thought came to him.</p>

<p>"Why, papa, I guess, 'cause he's got a picture
a good deal like it on the back of a letter that
mamma wrote him, and I saw him lookin' real
hard at it the other day, and I asked him what
'twas about, and he said, 'Oh, nothin'."</p>

<p>"Aha!"</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Did I say something? I must have been
merely clearing my throat."</p>

<p>"What a funny lot of noises you do make this
mornin'. Well, I guess I'll paste some pictures
in the book."</p>

<p>The Admiral lit a cigar, an indulgence of
which he never was guilty before dinner, except
when laboring under severe mental excitement.
One thing at least seemed clear; the letter, with
Jermyn's sketch, had not been destroyed; therefore
he, the Admiral, could hope to get it, for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>

men knew better than women the value of fifty
thousand dollars, and they would forgive other
men for asking pointed questions under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>But had Phil the Admiral's own sketch? If
so, why had he taken it from the book? Merely
to tease Trixy? Scarcely.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Admiral smote his forehead
and muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"How stupid of me. Mrs. Highwood herself
removed that picture. She knew that her
daughter had it; she knew the history of it, for
I told her all, and she can scarcely have forgotten
it. She has a woman's natural delicacy,
bless her, about the incident being recalled to
my mind, so knowing that Trixy was to bring
the book to my room she has abstracted the
sketch so that I should not see it and be reminded
of a mortifying experience. Oh, woman,
woman! How you do keep alive the human
tenderness that man does so much to kill!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the Admiral sprang to his
feet and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What if, to make assurance doubly sure, she
has destroyed that sketch!"</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br />
<span class="small">THREE BLIND MICE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM that time forward the Admiral was a
persistent caller at the Highwoods, for he
could not regain his natural composure until he
had seen and questioned Phil. The first evening
he called Phil had gone out to dinner with some
old classmates, and as the Admiral said nothing
of the purpose of his visit there was nothing to
prevent Phil from remaining late at his office
the next night.</p>

<p>All the while, too, Jermyn, whom the Admiral
met daily at breakfast, carried himself with an
air of bravado which was in the highest degree
exasperating. Was it possible that the fellow
had himself secured those sketches in some way,
and was having a malignantly delightful time in
torturing an old man who had been his best
friend? It did not seem possible, so one morning
the Admiral cautiously remarked:</p>

<p>"By the way, have you done anything about
those sketches?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about them?"</p>

<p>"No more than when we first came North."</p>

<p>"When do you intend to find out?"</p>

<p>"Never, if there's no way but the one you
have suggested."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't wonder," said the Admiral icily,
"that you're willing to lose your share of the
money, for a man in love is generally fool enough
to think that he, and particularly his wife, can
live on air, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Admiral!"</p>

<p>"Oh, be angry, if you like, but I mean it. On
the other hand, do you think it is conduct becoming
an officer and gentleman to deprive me
of a lot of money when I've several times put
myself to great inconvenience, out of unselfish
regard for you?"</p>

<p>"I'd do almost anything in the world to oblige
you, Admiral," replied Jermyn, "but after what
you've said regarding what you might do with
your share of the money, you can't blame me
for being reluctant."</p>

<p>"See here, dear boy," pleaded the Admiral,
"I'll withdraw that threat if you'll get merely
your own sketch. I'll cheerfully lose my own
share, if I may feel entirely comfortable about
your future."</p>

<p>That shot told. Jermyn could not endure the
thought of any man playing martyr for him, so
he answered somewhat sulkily:</p>

<p>"I must do it."</p>

<p>"Good! When?"</p>

<p>"Very soon."</p>

<p>"Time is precious, dear boy." Then the Admiral
told of his plan regarding Trixy's scrap-book,
and his defeat, and finally asked:</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose you could make another
sketch of the surroundings of that placer as you
did at the fort?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Easily."</p>

<p>The Admiral hastily offered the back of a letter
and a pencil, and followed with his eyes each
mark that Jermyn made. When the sketch was
almost complete, Jermyn stopped and asked:</p>

<p>"Why do you want this, Admiral?"</p>

<p>"For use as a voucher, in case your original
should be lost."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be a forgery!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Can a man forge his own signature?
What would you say in answer to that
question, if you were member of a court-martial?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know," replied Jermyn slowly,
"but&mdash;" here he paused long enough to tear the
paper into strips, and tear the strips crosswise,
"I must give my honor the benefit of the doubt."</p>

<p>"Oh, you idiot," exclaimed the old gentleman
angrily. "You're worse than an idiot, for you're
intimating that I, an officer and gentleman, am
counselling a crime."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Admiral. You know very well
that I couldn't, for an instant, think such a
thing. Still, any man must be ruled by his own
conscience."</p>

<p>Jermyn went down to the Sandy Hook proving-grounds,
and the Admiral spent a miserable
day, relieved somewhat by a call upon Kate, to
whom he determined to tell the whole story, and
to appeal to her, first for Jermyn's sake and then
for his own, to help him to get those sketches.
He knew women, he thought; Kate was a young
woman of unusual balance of mind, so she probably
had been sensible enough to wonder on
what she and Jermyn would live after they married.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>

They would soon marry, the Admiral was
sure; for love, like many other disturbances to
which humanity is subject, acts most powerfully
where longest delayed or avoided.</p>

<p>But, alas, for human courage! The veteran
who had led boarding parties and storming
parties, could not muster sufficient courage to
tell a woman that another woman had been bent
upon making a match for her, and that two men,
one of whom was the young woman's own lover,
had seen the plan in black and white, while Kate
herself had no thought of ever becoming Mrs.
Jermyn.</p>

<p>So he called again at the Highwoods, made a
full confession to Trif and her husband, and
begged for the sketches. Fortunately, the couple
were alone, Harry and Fenie having gone to a
dinner which the Trewmans were giving to both
happy couples. Phil seemed greatly amused by
the story, and said:</p>

<p>"So that explains the mystery of those two
pictures!" Then, for the first time, he told Trif
of meeting Jermyn in Madison Square, and of
Jermyn's strange embarrassment on seeing one
of the pictures, and how Phil himself had
chanced to see the other, only two or three days
before the Admiral's call, in Trixy's scrap-book,
extracted it, and put the two together to make a
pretense of mystery some evening for Trif's bewilderment
and his own amusement.</p>

<p>"You dreadful fellow!" exclaimed Trif.
"The idea of you keeping a secret from me&mdash;and
for three whole days!"</p>

<p>"But, pardon me," said the Admiral, "do
either of you find it impossible to forgive me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Phil, "it is impossible
to see where you were to blame. Trixy
herself took the letter to you and asked you to
finish it, so you couldn't help reading it. Neither
could you help supposing it to be what she
thought it, her own letter, for it began 'Dear
Old Papa.'"</p>

<p>"But," persisted the Admiral, "I was guilty,
shamefully so, that in my absent-mindedness I
took it from my pocket at the club, to sketch
upon."</p>

<p>"Just as I frequently use letters to figure
upon," said Phil.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you. And poor Jermyn,
in making his own sketch, and knowing, of
course, the subject of conversation, looked at
the written portion, supposing it to be something
pertinent to the subject."</p>

<p>"Quite naturally, and each of you afterward
had a lot of trouble which he didn't in the least
deserve."</p>

<p>"I don't see," said Trif, "that anyone is to
blame but I. The experience teaches me never
again to leave a letter unfinished."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," said Phil. "You see,
Admiral, that your loss is to be my gain. Hereafter
I'm not to be disappointed when longing
for letters."</p>

<p>"What letters, papa?" asked Trixy from the
sitting-room, where she was conducting a spelling
lesson for dolls.</p>

<p>"None, dear&mdash;tis nothing that you would
understand."</p>

<p>"If there is no feeling against me, therefore,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>

said the Admiral, adhering to the purpose of his
call, "would you mind, after erasing Mrs. Highwood's
lines, giving the sketches to me?"</p>

<p>"It will give me the greatest pleasure to place
them in your hands," said Phil, taking some
papers from the pocket of his coat. "Why,
they're not here! Hem! Ah, I remember; I
changed some papers hurriedly this morning to
my coat at the office, and apparently those were
among them. I'll get them to you to-morrow,
and leave them at your hotel as I come up
town."</p>

<p>"I shall be there to receive them," said the
Admiral, putting on a look of resignation. "Excuse
my eagerness and anxiety in the matter,
but those sketches have become a veritable
nightmare to me."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," said Phil, "considering
what they represent. Trixy, dear, don't laugh
so loud. What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm tellin' the dolls somethin' funny,
and I have to do the laughin' for the whole lot
of them, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Bless the child!" exclaimed the Admiral.
"Don't check her, please. I wonder if the dolls
would think it an intrusion if I were to look
on?"</p>

<p>"Phil!" said Trif, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear."</p>

<p>"Do you want to please me very much?"</p>

<p>"You know I do."</p>

<p>"Then go down to your office to-night for
those sketches&mdash;it isn't yet late enough for the
janitor to be asleep. I'm sure that our friend

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>

the Admiral, will sleep much easier when he has
those pictures securely in his possession."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't think of putting you to such
trouble," said the Admiral quickly, although he
told himself that Trif was a woman of a million.
Trif insisted, and begged the Admiral to wait
until Phil's return. It seemed to the old gentleman
that every minute of Phil's absence would
be an hour long, yet under Trif's influence the
minutes passed almost as quickly as seconds, so
before long Phil's step was heard in the hall.
Trif and the Admiral instinctively arose, but to
their surprise they saw a very blank face as Phil
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Tis the most provoking thing that ever
happened. Those sketches are nowhere in the
office."</p>

<p>"What can have become of them?" murmured
Trif.</p>

<p>"I've not the faintest idea. Here are some
more papers that were in the same pocket."</p>

<p>"'Foiled again,' as the villain always says in
a melodrama," remarked the Admiral; "kindly
consider me the villain." The old gentleman
was trying to make light of his disappointment,
but he looked so grave that Phil hastened to
say:</p>

<p>"I assure you, Admiral, that the sketches can
not possibly have been lost, nor can any one
have stolen them. I shall make thorough
search for them at once, and give myself no
peace until I have found them."</p>

<p>"I beg that you won't put yourself to any inconvenience,"
said the Admiral. Nevertheless,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>

he made haste to take his departure, hoping
that the search would begin at once and continue
through the night, unless the missing papers
were sooner found.</p>

<p>"I shall carry them to you, in person, as soon
as I get them," were Phil's parting words.</p>

<p>"Come at any hour," replied the Admiral.
"Don't fear that you may disturb me."</p>

<p>Then he went to his hotel, and hopefully,
fearfully, remained awake until and through the
"dog watch" hours, but in vain.</p>

<span class="small">THE OTHER COUPLE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">AS Harry and Fenie had no prospective fortunes
complicated by scraps of paper in
another man's pocket, they had every reason to
be entirely happy, yet soon they found themselves
very much to the contrary. Fenie had
begun early, like a loyal wife that was to be, to
tell Harry of everything that was on her mind,
and Harry, like a good brother, began to be
concerned about his sister's prospects. The
family fortunes were not in as bad condition as
Trixy had led the Admiral to fear, but what
loving brother could be entirely cheerful while
his sister was in danger of losing fifty thousand
dollars?</p>

<p>He began to be absent-minded at home, and
Kate quickly noticed it, and asked him what was
the matter, and when he replied, "Nothing," he
did it in a tone that whatever was the matter
was the reverse of nothing, so she set herself to
discovering what it could be. She at once
assumed that it was trouble of some sort between
him and Fenie, and she determined to
rectify it, no matter what it might be. They
were mere children, Harry and Fenie, in Kate's
estimation, and would need her sisterly care and
supervision until they were safely married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>With the best of intentions she called upon
Fenie to find out all about it, and she found the
girl in a state of high excitement, for she had
been helping Trif to search every place in the
house where those awful sketches could possibly
have been put, for Phil, like many another man,
was an adept at dropping the contents of his
pockets in unexpected places. Kate was thinking
of nothing but the business on which she
had come, so she proceeded promptly to business.</p>

<p>"Harry seems quite unhappy," she began
bluntly. "He is entirely unlike his usual merry
self."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" replied Fenie vacantly.</p>

<p>"Yes; he looks as if he had slept scarcely a
wink last night."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Fenie with a slight
frown.</p>

<p>Kate was somewhat provoked at this, but she
controlled herself and continued:</p>

<p>"I asked him what was troubling him, but he
wouldn't tell me, although he has always made
me his confidant."</p>

<p>Fenie looked uncomfortable, but she showed
no sign of becoming communicative, so Kate
went on:</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose I would be of any service
to you or him in the matter?"</p>

<p>"Not in the slightest degree," said Fenie,
with a start. She was thinking only of the
ridiculousness of Kate assisting at the work of
rummaging the pockets of the various garments
which Phil had worn since he missed the
sketches, but Kate naturally failed to imagine
that, so she misconstrued the gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do hope, dear," she said, as sympathetically
as she could, "that it isn't anything serious!"</p>

<p>"But it is," said Fenie, looking as if she would
like the subject dropped. For that very reason
Kate clung to it determinedly.</p>

<p>"Serious?&mdash;for two people who ought to love
each other very dearly?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Fenie bluntly. She was afraid
to say much, for, if she gave Kate any clue to
the matter, she did not know how much further
she might be persuaded to go. She knew that
her tongue sometimes ran away with her, and
she was not going to let Kate know anything
about the missing letter and its double contents.</p>

<p>Suddenly Trif, who did not know that there
was a visitor in the parlor, called Fenie, and the
girl, glad of an excuse, hurried away with the
promise that she would return in a moment.
When, however, she explained to her sister, Trif
told her she was very silly not to see that Kate
was misunderstanding matters, and supposing
there was trouble between Fenie and Harry.</p>

<p>"But," said Fenie, "as she already knows that
it concerns a couple who ought to love each other
very dearly&mdash;those were her own words&mdash;she will
think there is something wrong between her and
Jermyn, or between you and Phil." Trif was perplexed
by this view of the matter, so she and
her sister set themselves to devise some way of
throwing Kate off the scent, and, as neither of
them had any experience in deceit, they evolved
and discarded several plans in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Kate was becoming restive. She had a woman's
sense of the courtesy that was due her, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>

she began to feel hurt by what seemed to be neglect.
Just then Trixy meandered into the parlor,
from nowhere in particular, and Kate had
no scruples about questioning her.</p>

<p>"Trixy, dear," she said, "I'm very glad to see
you."</p>

<p>Trixy indulged in a long stare before she
replied:</p>

<p>"That's funny! You don't look as if you was."</p>

<p>"Don't I? I'm very sorry for it. The truth
is, I'm greatly troubled about several things.
I'm afraid, for one thing, that Harry and Fenie
aren't as happy as they have been."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," was the reply, "though
I wouldn't have thought of it if you hadn't said
so. They talked awful solemn to each other last
night. I don't know what they was talkin'
about, but once Harry put his hands all over his
face and said: 'Oh, 'twill be awful&mdash;awful!'"</p>

<p>"Dear me! And what did your Aunt Fee
say?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say nothin' for a long time, and
then she said she thought he was makin' altogether
too much fuss about it."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, except she said somethin'
about Mr. Jermyn bein' a real fine fellow anyway,
so she thought Harry ought to be quiet, and
make the best of it."</p>

<p>Jermyn! Aha! Harry was jealous! How
much cause had he? If any, then she, Kate,
had quite as much. Oh, the ways of very young
women! Was Fenie's head still turned by the
attention which Jermyn had paid her at Old

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>

Point? Had she really lost her heart to him?
Was she tiring of Harry, and wishing she might
yet capture the officer? Jermyn had admitted
to Kate that he had been greatly impressed by
Fenie until she, Kate, herself appeared on the
scene, but it couldn't be possible that he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Trixy?" said Kate suddenly, "does Lieutenant
Jermyn come here often?" She was
ashamed of herself as soon as she had spoken,
for when could he call? Was he not at the
proving-grounds all day, and at Kate's own
home every evening until late? Still, the
question had been asked, so she awaited the
answer.</p>

<p>"Why, no. He came here this mornin', very
early, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And your mamma saw him?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma was out."</p>

<p>"So you entertained him?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't either. I wanted to, 'cause I
like him lots, but he and Aunt Fee began talkin'
about a letter, and then Aunt Fee told me to get
all my new dolls to show him, now that they've
all got new dresses, and it took me a lot of time
to get them all together, and when I came back
with 'em he was gone."</p>

<p>Kate was angry, but of one thing she informed
herself at once&mdash;it was that she was not going
to lose Bruce Jermyn because of any flirtation
he might have had with that flighty girl, or of
any letters that might have passed between
them. Men would be flirts, she supposed&mdash;that
is, bachelors would&mdash;but she would marry Bruce
Jermyn, even if he had flirted with half the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>

women in creation. She had long cherished the
fine belief that no man ever strays from a woman
who appreciates him; when she became Mrs.
Jermyn she would be everything to him that
wife could be to husband, and then she would
defy anyone, even a girl as pretty as Fenie, to
get and keep a bit of his heart.</p>

<p>As to Fenie, it would break Harry's heart to
lose her, and if temptation were out of her way
she probably would love Harry sincerely after
they were married. Jermyn would be out of the
way in a day or two,&mdash;but, oh, how she did wish
she knew what was in the letter which the two
had talked about?</p>

<p>Fenie finally returned and Kate said to her:</p>

<p>"You expect Harry this evening, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I hope you will have a very pleasant evening
with each other."</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I. I hope it will be pleasanter
than last evening. If that dreadful let&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fenie stopped abruptly, but it was too late.
Kate was regarding her searchingly, and Fenie's
face became scarlet.</p>

<p>"What letter do you refer to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask, please." Fenie felt that she
should scream.</p>

<p>"A letter which has made much unhappiness
for you and Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes; yes; oh, yes!" Fenie looked so miserable
that Kate almost forgave her. After all,
was she not a mere girl? Perhaps a womanly
word, spoken in season, might do her good,
beside providing peace for Kate's own mind in
the future. So she began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe you're real sorry about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed I am; sorrier than I can begin
to tell you."</p>

<p>"Then, dear," said Kate, compelling a genuine
pardoning spirit to take possession of herself,
"try to think no more about it, no matter what
the contents of the letter may be. Let bygones
be bygones. Some things must be lived down,
if we are to be all we should. Do your share
toward it, and all may yet be well."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;and Jermyn&mdash;"</p>

<p>So Jermyn really was implicated! Nevertheless,
Kate set her lips firmly and replied:</p>

<p>"Jermyn shall live it down; I shall never
recall the matter to his attention, but shall
do all in my power to make him forget the
letter."</p>

<p>"But," said Fenie, with a wondering look,
"how did you chance to know anything about
it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. You still love
Harry, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes!"</p>

<p>"And you will show him that letter&mdash;after
you are married?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;if it is ever found."</p>

<p>Kate wanted one more proof of Fenie's repentance;
it was a hard one to exact, but she
was determined to have it.</p>

<p>"You will show the letter to me too?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;after you are married, and if you'll
promise to forgive us."</p>

<p>"I do promise&mdash;now!" said Kate, and departed
with the air of one who had done a noble

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>

deed, while Fenie hurried to Trif and told her
that Kate already knew about that letter,
despite all that had been done to keep any
knowledge of it from her, and Trif wondered
how she could have learned, and said that
Harry must have told her, and Fenie retorted
that Harry was no tell-tale child, and that it
must have been Jermyn or the Admiral, and
that whichever it was he was real mean, for
hadn't Trif, while writing the letter, planned
merely what had come to pass, to the manifest
delight of the parties most nearly interested?</p>

<p>Kate improved her first opportunity to warn
her brother against long engagements, and
Harry asked whether she herself was willing to
practice what she preached, and Kate bravely
answered that she was.</p>

<p>"But let that subject rest, for the present,"
she said. "I've learned some things accidentally
to-day, and I don't wonder that you have
been so unhappy for a day or two. You needn't
be afraid to call on Fenie this evening. There
will be nothing unpleasant."</p>

<p>"My dear sister!" exclaimed Harry, "what
are you talking about? What have you learned,
and where, and how?"</p>

<p>"Entirely by accident. Trixy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trixy? Goodness! Will that child never
cease to make trouble?"</p>

<p>Then Harry dashed out of the room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br />
<span class="small">THREE DAYS GRACE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Admiral worried himself almost sick
over Phil Highwood's inability to find the
missing sketches, and his condition of mind and
body was not improved by a meeting which he
had with the projector of the new mining company.
That gentleman insisted that the sketches
should be filed at once, for his promise from his
fellow-incorporators had been merely verbal,
and he warned the Admiral that such promises
were frequently ignored in business, and that
he, the projector, would be powerless to force
the matter should his associates vote against
him.</p>

<p>The Admiral explained the cause of the delay
and the importance of the matter to Jermyn in
particular, and this affected the projector so
strongly, he once having been a poor young man
engaged to be married, that he succeeded in exacting
from the directors a written promise that
if the sketches were deposited with the company
within three days from date the stock
should be delivered; otherwise it would be disposed
of elsewhere.</p>

<p>All this caused the old gentleman to once
more speak to Jermyn about the matter, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>

Jermyn, noting the condition to which excitement
had brought his friend, and not knowing
that the Admiral had already made a clean
breast of the matter to the Highwoods, one
morning went to throw himself upon Trif's
mercy, but, as already intimated, he saw only
Fenie. He succeeded in telling her the story,
but when he learned that the sketches had disappeared
he became about as miserable as the
Admiral.</p>

<p>Had he spoken when first the sketches were
asked for, there would have been no trouble, he
learned; he therefore reproached himself severely
for his friend's sake and for Kate's, and
began wondering how he could ever make
amends to the man who had done so much for
him. As an army officer's opportunities for
making fifty thousand dollars are practically
non-existent, he became so moody that Kate
thought her suspicions about him and Fenie
were verified.</p>

<p>But Kate was not going to lose a happy evening
from the short remainder of Jermyn's leave
of absence, as she persisted in calling his assignment
to duty at Sandy Hook. As she was
going to be magnanimous, and had begun finely,
she resolved to complete the task, so she exclaimed
to Jermyn suddenly one evening:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, I want you to stop thinking
about that letter. Don't start&mdash;nor ask me any
questions. I'll promise to overlook it, and forget
all about it, in the course of time, if you
will be your old self once more."</p>

<p>"But I never can forget it," replied Jermyn,
"never! Think of the cruelty of it, to you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if I ignore it, and cast it from my mind
forever, why should you persist in cherishing it
and being miserable about it?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because I am a man and love you."</p>

<p>"I shall love you the more, because you have
been so miserable about the matter. Won't that
satisfy you?"</p>

<p>How grand a woman she was, Jermyn thought!
Still, how could she have learned about that letter,
and the drawings that made it so valuable?
Had the Admiral told her, and asked her to add
her entreaties to his own? Trif could not have
been the informer; she had every reason for
avoiding the subject, in conversation with Kate.
Kate had said he must not ask her how she
learned about the tormenting paper; but suddenly
he found out, or thought he did, for Kate
said:</p>

<p>"Will it make your mind any easier to know
that I have fully forgiven her?"</p>

<p>"Then you really know all?" said he, looking
into her eyes. He did it very coolly, in the circumstances,
Kate thought, but she was not going
to recede a bit from the greatness of magnanimity
upon which she had resolved, so she
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, all; but why should I harbor any ill
feeling? Besides, she is quite weak and silly.
She will know more when she grows older."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear you speak of her in that
way," said Jermyn, gravely. "I had hoped that
you and she would become very warm friends;
indeed, I supposed you were so already."</p>

<p>Kate darted a suspicious look at Jermyn.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>

Was there duplicity in a man apparently so
honest? If so, her faith in human nature would
be forever lost.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish us to be warm friends?"
she asked, coldly. "So that you may frequently
have her near you?"</p>

<p>Jermyn looked amazed and indignant as he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Kate, I swear to you that the tender regard
I once had for her is gone forever. Do believe
me."</p>

<p>"Then it was not you who wrote the letter
about which you and she have been so troubled
about in the last few days?"</p>

<p>"I? Why, you said you knew all about it!
Don't you know that she wrote it?"</p>

<p>"The forward minx!"</p>

<p>"I thought you said you had forgiven her?"</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't! The idea of a girl as careful
as Fenie Wardlow professes to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear girl, you've been dreadfully misinformed
in some way. Fenie didn't write the
letter; 'twas her sister."</p>

<p>"Jermyn!" exclaimed Kate, utterly aghast.
What was the world coming to? She had heard
of married women who pretended to adore their
husbands, and who intrigued with other men,
but she supposed they were far from the society
in which she moved. So it was Trif and her&mdash;carelessness,
call it, over which Fenie had been
so uncomfortable when Kate called, a few hours
back! Oh, the wickedness of the world! Whom
now was there to trust?</p>

<p>"So," said Kate, slowly and coldly, "it was a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>

married woman, one whom I have respected
and loved, who wrote you the letter which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, Kate&mdash;at once. There is a dreadful
mistake somewhere. Let us be entirely frank
with each other, for the good of all concerned.
The only letter about which I have had any discomfort
is one which Mrs. Highwood wrote to
her own husband."</p>

<p>"Her own husband!" echoed Kate, with a
blank stare.</p>

<p>"Yes. Let us begin at the beginning, and
get your mind out of this dreadful tangle. Do
tell me from whom, and how, you got your
information about that unspeakably troublesome
letter?"</p>

<p>"From Trixy," answered Kate, feebly; at
which Jermyn laughed heartily before he replied:</p>

<p>"I might have imagined it. The little marplot!
Now listen: the letter is one which Mrs. Highwood
wrote her husband, from Old Point, on
two subjects, one of which was very delightful,
for it was you; I was the other. By an accident,
which I will explain later, the letter fell
into the Admiral's hands, and he, not distinguishing
it from several others which he took
from his pocket an hour or two afterward, made
a sketch upon the back of it; I, who chanced to
be with him, made another. Both sketches are
now needed, at once, to perfect some business
arrangements in which the Admiral and I are
greatly interested and by which we might profit
greatly, but Highwood, to whom his wife sent
the letter when she regained it, has mislaid the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>

sheet, or the two parts of it, and the Admiral
and I, as well as the entire Highwood family,
are greatly troubled about it."</p>

<p>"So is Harry and Fenie," said Kate, as if
talking to herself. "What an idiot I have been!
How they will laugh at my expense! But oh, I
am so happy, although I don't deserve to be, for
I have been jealous, suspicious, hateful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do restrain yourself, my dear girl."</p>

<p>"I've also been meddlesome," Kate continued,
"and impertinent, and, worse than all,
inexpressibly stupid, on account of that dreadful
letter. Meanwhile, I am being heartless, for
you said the loss of the letter was making
trouble for you and the Admiral. How much is
the trouble&mdash;to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, merely fifty thousand dollars worth."</p>

<p>"Jermyn! I supposed that I had promised to
marry an army officer with nothing but his
salary, and I was priding myself on marrying
for love alone, without any of the sordid ideas
which fill women's heads, as well as men's, in
these selfish days, but you seem&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't change your mind, I beg, for I am
fully as poor as you thought me. I expect to be
fifty thousand dollars better off if that letter
with my sketch comes to light within a few
hours; otherwise my entire fortune is the
couple of thousand dollars I have saved."</p>

<p>Kate smiled bravely and sweetly as she replied:</p>

<p>"Please don't omit me, while you're giving an
account of your possessions. Not that I have
any money, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bless you!" exclaimed Jermyn, with the
demonstration appropriate to the circumstances.
There was a short silence, which Kate broke by
saying:</p>

<p>"I wonder what was in that letter about you
and me."</p>

<p>Jermyn did not answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know?" Kate asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then tell me."</p>

<p>"I can't, my dear&mdash;really I can't."</p>

<p>"Do you think it right that either of us should
keep anything from the other?"</p>

<p>"No; but a communication from a husband
to his wife belongs only to the two&mdash;Mr. and
Mrs. Highwood."</p>

<p>"Never mind. I shall know it all some day.
Fenie promised that I should."</p>

<p>"Indeed? When is she to tell you?"</p>

<p>"After I am married."</p>

<p>"And you are very, very curious to know?"</p>

<p>"Wildly so!"</p>

<p>"I can see but one way to assist you."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Can't you imagine?"</p>

<p>"No. Do tell me&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>Jermyn took her hands in his and replied:</p>

<p>"'Tis only this; get married as soon as possible.
I shall soon be entitled to ask for two
more weeks of absence, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall be ready," said Kate softly, yet with
a look which made Jermyn wonder how much
happier a man could be without losing his
senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"One thing I must do at once, though," said
Kate, suddenly regaining her alertness and self-control.
"I must apologize abjectly to Fenie
for my shameful suspicion that she had been engaged
in a flirtation with you. I must do it
this very evening. Please take me around there
at once."</p>

<p>"And rob myself of one of my few remaining
hours of bliss?"</p>

<p>"You must learn to be blissful while doing
whatever I wish you to do."</p>

<p>Fenie was so surprised by the communication
which Kate made that she did not think to be
indignant; on the contrary, she laughed, which
was the worst punishment she could have inflicted.
Meanwhile, Trif was telling Jermyn
that he and Kate must take dinner with her and
Phil the next night. The other happy couple
would be present, so would the Admiral, and
the dinner would be the finest she had ever arranged.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Trixy, "there's to be ice-cream,
and the other kind of ice, and mamma says I
can eat a lot of both; and there's to be a s'prise,
too."</p>

<p>Trif nodded warningly at Trixy. She could
not remember which of her prospective dishes
had been alluded to in family conversation as a
surprise, yet she warned her daughter to be
quiet.</p>

<p>"She doesn't mean the letter?" whispered
Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Alas, no!" sighed Trif. "How I wish it
might be!"</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a><br />
<span class="small">THAT SURPRISE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE dinner was all that Trif had promised,
and the guests were in high spirits, although
some of them had believed in advance that it
would be almost like a funeral feast, for were
there not two blocks of stock which would not
go out of the minds of at least two of the party?</p>

<p>Good manners prevented any show of sadness,
and good company soon did the rest. There
was an abundance of merry chat, and the host
and hostess, with Harry and Fenie, encouraged
the Admiral and Jermyn to tell stories of field
and flood, of which civilians seem never to tire,
so it was not until late in the evening that the
party arose from the table. Then the ladies
were begged for music, and the officers were
coaxed to sing, and time flew so rapidly that it
was almost midnight when the guests said they
must take their leave, and Trif murmured that
Trixy ought to have been put to bed hours
before, but the dear child had been so quiet
that her mother had scarcely known she was
present.</p>

<p>"I dislike to bring up unpleasant subjects on
such an occasion," said Phil, "but before we
separate I must express my great sorrow and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>

mortification at the loss of those pictures. I
never before had so serious an accident, and I
wish it were in my power to make some reparation."</p>

<p>"There is one way in which you can do it, my
dear sir," replied the Admiral.</p>

<p>"What? Do name it and it shall be done."</p>

<p>"It is merely this. Kindly persuade your
wife to re-write, from memory, and on the same
kind of paper, if possible, the letter which,
through my stupidity, has caused all the trouble.
Have her write it with the same kind of ink;
then give the letter to me!"</p>

<p>"I'll do it at once," said Trif.</p>

<p>"And you'll show me the letter?" added Kate.</p>

<p>"Not for worlds!" answered Trif, with a
laugh and a blush that made Kate still more
curious.</p>

<p>"What then?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Admiral, firmly, "I shall
duplicate my pencil sketch upon the back of it;
Jermyn shall duplicate his on the back of the
written page, and I shall file both as vouchers."</p>

<p>"A most brilliant plan!" exclaimed Phil.
"Eh, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"Brilliant enough," was the reply, "but I
don't entirely like it. My friend, the Admiral, is
the most honest man alive, yet to me the plan
seems very like forgery."</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all!" said Phil. "A man can't
forge his own writing or drawing. Besides,
there's no question of morals involved. The
company is willing to give the stock, in payment
for services rendered, the services made by you

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>

gentlemen, showing how to get water to property
which would be worthless without it. No other
man, should he find the originals, can possibly
present them or use them in any way, for he
would not know what they signified, nor could
he find any one but the existing company who
could apply them to the property in question.
Neither of you have talked of the matter elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe," said the Admiral, with a
long sigh, a shake of the head, and a reminiscent
wink at Jermyn, "that any matter which
affected business has ever been kept close by
two men&mdash;eh, Jermyn?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, Admiral. Still, as to duplicating
my sketch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't prevent me, at least," the Admiral
replied, "so I shall beg Mrs. Highwood to re-write
the letter at once. If Jermyn chooses to throw
away fifty thousand dollars&mdash;oh, Miss Trewman,
you have more influence over him than any one
else; do reason with him. Better still, command
him. Don't let him throw good money to
the dogs."</p>

<p>"What dogs? Who's throwin' money to
'em?" drawled Trixy, who had begun to fall
asleep.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jermyn, my dear, is doing it," said Phil,
"and all because your own father stupidly lost a
couple of pictures."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" exclaimed the child, yawning
and rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>"What shall I do, my dear?" asked Jermyn,
as Kate turned an anxious face toward him.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>

"The money, should I get it, will be practically
yours; that is, it will enable me to support my
wife far better than my unaided salary will."</p>

<p>The Admiral, Fenie and Harry looked intently
at Kate. Trif, at a table in the sitting
room, had been writing rapidly with her husband
looking over her shoulder. When she
had finished Phil took the pen and did something
to the letter, at which Trif nodded approvingly
and then slyly drew Phil's face down to
her and kissed it. Then she tore the two leaves
of the sheet apart, and gave one to each of the
despoiled men, saying,</p>

<p>"Admiral, this is the portion which you used.
Jermyn, this is yours. Kate, have you brought
him to his senses?"</p>

<p>"Shall I?" asked Jermyn.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kate, "if you think it right."</p>

<p>"But I don't."</p>

<p>"Then you shan't" exclaimed Kate, snatching
the paper from him. "No one shall ever
blame you, though, for 'tisn't you who are throwing
away the money; it is I."</p>

<p>She stepped quickly toward the grate, extended
her hand, stopped, turned her head and
said:</p>

<p>"As some reward for my self-sacrifice, mayn't
I read the letter before I burn it?"</p>

<p>"You poor child!" murmured Trif.</p>

<p>"What? Was it as bad as that?"</p>

<p>"Look at it, Kate," said Phil, "and you will
know what Trif means."</p>

<p>In a second Kate was under the chandelier and
turning the sheet, but as she looked her face

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>

became blank, for Phil, supposing the paper
was to go into the hands of a lot of business
men, had penned over every line so skillfully,
after the manner of commercial correspondents
who make erasures in letters, that not a word
of the original writing was decipherable.</p>

<p>"You shall know it all, you dear disappointed
girl," said Trif. "I shall tell you every word of
it this very evening&mdash;this very moment. Come
with me; I know the others will excuse us under
the circumstances."</p>

<p>Together they started to leave the room, but
encountered Trixy, who was just entering.</p>

<p>"I most forgot about that s'prise," said the
child to Jermyn, as she stopped before him.
"The dinner was so good, and you folks talked
so much, that I didn't get a chance to say
nothin', and then I got sleepy while you was
singin', and I'd have forgot all about it entirely
if you hadn't begun to talk about throwin'
money to dogs, and papa explained how it was."</p>

<p>Then she raised both hands high in the air and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Here's your old pictures."</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," shouted the Admiral,
springing forward, and snatching both sketches.
He explained afterward, very sheepishly, that
he believed his mind had been weakened by long
anxiety about those sketches, for he imagined
himself young again, and taking part in a landing
party in Mexico.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trixy," exclaimed Trif, snatching her
child into her arms, "you naughty, precious,
dreadful, blessed, awful, angelic, terrible, lovely
darling!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jermyn!" exclaimed Kate, and Jermyn
opened his arms, while Fenie gasped "Harry!"
and Harry made haste to support her. The
ladies being thus disposed of, the Admiral and
Phil could only shake hands, which they did
with a vigor that made each man wince. Finally
Phil said:</p>

<p>"My dear, will you kindly stop kissing that
child long enough for me to ask her a question?
Trixy, where did you get those sketches?"</p>

<p>"Why, I found out that 'twas you that took
one of 'em out of my scrap-book, and I thought
it was just one of your tricks, so I'd play one
on you, and the first thing I knew I got the
chance, 'cause a lot of papers fell out of a coat
of yours on a chair, and there was one of the
pictures on the outside of a letter, and 'twas my
own picture, so I took it, and afterwards I found
there was one somethin' like it on the inside
part of the letter, and I was goin' to tell you,
some time, how nicely I had tricked you.
Then I heard a lot of talk about pictures that
the Admiral and Mr. Jermyn wanted, and I
thought mebbe I had 'em, and I knew mamma
was goin' to have both of the gentlemen here
to dinner in a day or two, and I thought I'd
keep the s'prise till then, when there'd be more
people to laugh at it."</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Trif with frightened eyes,
"that I had set the dinner for to-morrow instead
of to-day!"</p>

<p>"But you didn't, my dear madam," said the
Admiral. "All the world loves a lover, and I
devoutly believe heaven does too. Suppose

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>

that you had put Trixy to bed at the usual
hour!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!"</p>

<p>"Let me see the sketches, Admiral," said
Kate. She looked at them carelessly, turned
them over, and said:</p>

<p>"Trif, the writing on this page has been
erased. May I read it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, if you will take it into the next
room."</p>

<p>Kate was absent several moments&mdash;a long
time, Jermyn said, to read what his own eyes
had seen at a glance, but when she returned
she embraced Trif effusively and Jermyn told
himself that Kate's eyes were most angelic
when they were dewy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a double wedding in June, and the
Admiral, by permission of both families, gave
away both brides. Trixy strewed flowers in
front of each couple as they walked up the
aisle of the church, and she looked and felt as
important as if she were both brides. Neither
couple asked her to be their guest on their
wedding journey, which she thought rather
strange, in view of their extreme affection for
her, and her mother had much difficulty in
explaining. Both brides, however, had her visit
them soon afterward, and for so long a time

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
